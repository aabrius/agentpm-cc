Product & Project Document Templates

This comprehensive guide defines standardized Markdown templates for 34 common product/project documents. Each template outlines fixed sections based on industry best practices, with references to credible sources in Product Management, UX, Engineering, Agile, DevOps, and Architecture. We avoid duplicating content across templates by clarifying how each document’s scope relates to others. Use these templates as starting frameworks – adapt section details to your specific project context.

1. Product Vision Document

A Product Vision Document communicates the high-level vision and purpose of a product. It aligns stakeholders on the long-term aspiration for the product and its value to customers and the business. This document is typically short and inspirational, focusing on what the product aims to achieve and who it serves. A strong product vision captures the target customer, their needs, the product’s unique value proposition, and how it ties to business goals ￼ ￼. It serves as a North Star for strategy and feeds into more detailed plans like the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

Template Structure:
	•	Product Name & Vision Statement – A concise statement or tagline conveying the product’s ultimate goal and differentiation. For example, “Our vision is to empower [target users] to [achieve key benefit], unlike any other solution.” Ensure it is clear and specific to avoid ambiguity ￼.
	•	Target Market & User – Define who the product serves (customer segments or personas) and their core needs ￼. Summarize market research on user demographics or psychographics relevant to the vision.
	•	User Problems & Needs – List the primary problems/pain points of target users that the product will solve. This grounds the vision in real user needs ￼.
	•	Product Value Proposition – Describe how the product will solve those problems and deliver unique value. Tie the product’s benefits to the user’s desired outcomes and to business objectives ￼ ￼.
	•	Success Metrics – Outline long-term success criteria for the vision (e.g. adoption, customer satisfaction, market share) to clarify what realizing the vision looks like. These are not detailed KPIs but broad indicators.
	•	Strategic Fit & Objectives – Explain how the product vision aligns with the company’s mission or strategic goals. For example, note if it enables entry into a new market or advances a key company objective ￼.
	•	Scope & Constraints (Optional) – If needed, clarify any boundaries of the vision. For example, note what the product will not pursue or assumptions (e.g. platform focus).

Justification: This structure is inspired by product management best practices. A good vision captures the target customer, the need, and the value, linking to business goals ￼. Including target audience and problem context ensures the vision is grounded and not “lofty and intangible” ￼. High-level success metrics help gauge if the vision is achieved ￼.

Relationship to Other Documents: The Product Vision Document provides the guiding “why” for the product. It precedes and informs the Business Requirements and Product Requirements documents. For example, the vision’s defined customer needs feed into the PRD’s features, and its success metrics set context for the Market Analysis and Product Roadmap. While the vision is high-level, details like competitive analysis or financials are covered in Market Analysis or Strategy docs ￼ rather than in the vision itself, avoiding duplication.

2. Business Requirements Document (BRD)

The Business Requirements Document (BRD) defines what the business needs from the project or product – focusing on the business perspective and high-level requirements. It outlines the business objectives, stakeholder needs, and functional requirements at a broad level (often from a user or process standpoint) ￼ ￼. The BRD ensures all stakeholders share a clear understanding of the project’s scope and objectives before diving into product or technical specifics.

Template Structure:
	•	Executive Summary & Background – A brief overview of the project’s purpose, business context, and drivers. Include key business problems to be solved and project scope in summary form ￼.
	•	Business Objectives – List the business goals the project should achieve (e.g. increase revenue by X, improve NPS, comply with regulation). This answers why the business is undertaking the project ￼.
	•	Scope of Work – Define the project scope: what’s included versus excluded. Clearly state which business processes, departments, or product areas are affected ￼ ￼. Also note out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep.
	•	Stakeholder Analysis – Identify key stakeholders (internal and external) and their needs or expectations ￼. Include a table of stakeholder roles (e.g. Marketing, Operations) and their interests in the project.
	•	Business Requirements – The core of the BRD: a structured list of requirements from a business standpoint. Describe each requirement in clear terms of what is needed (not how). These can be grouped by category or process. Include both functional requirements (features, capabilities) and non-functional requirements that impact business (e.g. security, SLA) ￼ ￼. For each, you may include acceptance criteria or business rationale.
	•	Current vs. Future State (Gap Analysis) – (If applicable) Describe the current business process or system and the desired future state. Highlight gaps and changes required ￼. This ensures the team understands business workflow changes.
	•	Constraints & Assumptions – Document any business constraints (budget limits, deadlines, regulatory constraints) or assumptions made (e.g. certain resources will be available) ￼.
	•	Success Criteria – Define how the business will measure success (e.g. specific KPIs or acceptance criteria for the requirements) ￼. This provides a basis for validating that requirements are met.
	•	Approval & Sign-off – Provide a section for stakeholder approval of the BRD (signatures or recorded agreement), confirming consensus on requirements.

Justification: This structure follows industry guidelines ￼ and BABOK best practices. It includes objectives and scope to set context ￼, a thorough listing of business requirements (functional and non-functional) ￼, plus constraints and criteria to ensure clarity ￼ ￼. Including current vs future process analysis is recommended to align everyone on what will change ￼. Quality control measures (success criteria) and stakeholder sign-off ensure the BRD is clear and agreed upon ￼ ￼.

Relationship to Other Documents: The BRD is a foundational input for the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Project Plan. It represents what the business needs which the PRD will translate into detailed product features. The BRD also informs the Design Requirements and Test Plan by defining scope and high-level criteria. Unlike the PRD or SRS, the BRD stays high-level and avoids technical implementation – those details appear in the Technical Spec or SRS, preventing duplication. Changes in business requirements captured here should trace through to the Traceability Matrix and User Stories to ensure fulfillment.

3. PRD – Product Requirements Document

The Product Requirements Document (PRD) specifies the product features and functionalities to be built in order to meet the business requirements and user needs. It is a detailed, user-focused description of what the product should do. A PRD guides the development team on features, use cases, and acceptance criteria, ensuring everyone aligns on the product’s scope ￼ ￼. It is often written by product managers and balances stakeholder needs, user personas, and technical feasibility.

Template Structure:
	•	Product Overview – Brief context for the product/feature. State the product’s purpose, target users/personas, and how this PRD’s scope ties to the broader vision or release. This echoes the vision but in concrete terms ￼.
	•	Goals and Non-Goals – List the specific product goals for this release or feature set (what value to deliver) and explicitly mention out-of-scope items (“non-goals”) to clarify boundaries ￼.
	•	User Personas & Use Cases – Identify the key user personas (or roles) relevant to these requirements ￼. For each persona, outline primary use cases or user scenarios that the product must support ￼. This grounds features in real user workflows.
	•	Product Features & Requirements – Detailed requirements broken down by feature. For each feature or functional area:
	•	Description – What the feature does and why (the user story or problem addressed). E.g., “The system shall allow a user to create a profile…”.
	•	User Story(ies) – (Optional) Provide user story format requirements: “As a [user], I want [ability], so that [benefit].” This ensures clarity on user value ￼ ￼.
	•	Functional Requirements – Enumerate specific requirements for the feature (often numbered). Include details on behavior, data inputs/outputs, error states, etc., as needed to implement. Keep them implementation-free (concentrate on what, not how).
	•	Acceptance Criteria – List the conditions that must be met for the feature to be accepted as done ￼ ￼. These are often testable statements (e.g., “Given X, when Y happens, then Z result”). Acceptance criteria ensure clarity on when a requirement is fulfilled.
	•	Non-functional or Constraints (if any) – Note any performance, security, or usability constraints specific to this feature.
	•	Wireframes or UX Notes – (If applicable) Include low-fidelity wireframes, mockups, or workflow diagrams to illustrate key interactions. Each wireframe can be annotated to tie to requirements ￼ ￼. (Detailed design is in the UX Design Doc, but critical UI expectations can be noted here for context).
	•	Assumptions & Dependencies – Document any assumptions (e.g. user has an account) or dependencies on other features/systems. E.g., “Feature A depends on the API from Project X” ensures teams coordinate.
	•	Metrics & Success Criteria – Define how to measure success of these features post-release (e.g. “Increase conversion of signup by 15%”). These tie back to the objectives and help prioritize features ￼.
	•	Open Questions – Track any unresolved issues or outstanding decisions (e.g. “TBD: final copy for error messages; needs UX input”). This invites resolution before development completes ￼.

Justification: This PRD structure aligns with modern product management guidance ￼ ￼. It starts with user context (personas, use cases) to keep a user-centered focus ￼. The heart of the PRD is clearly defined features with user stories and acceptance criteria, which multiple sources recommend for actionable, testable requirements ￼ ￼. Outlining non-goals and assumptions prevents scope creep and misalignment ￼. Including wireframes and UX notes fosters understanding between product and design/engineering, as Aha’s template suggests linking to design explorations ￼ ￼. Acceptance criteria and metrics tie the PRD to validation and business outcomes ￼ ￼.

Relationship to Other Documents: The PRD is informed by the Business Requirements (BRD) and the Product Vision – it translates business needs into specific product capabilities. It overlaps with the SRS (Software Requirements Spec) but focuses more on user-facing features and behavior, while the SRS may include more technical requirements and interfaces. To avoid duplication, technical implementation details are left for the Technical Spec or Architecture/Design Doc. The PRD’s user stories and acceptance criteria flow into the Feature Requirements (FRD) and User Story documents, and they guide the Test Plan (QA uses acceptance criteria from the PRD to derive test cases ￼ ￼). In agile teams, the PRD often populates the product backlog (epics/stories) – see the Epic and User Story templates – ensuring consistency from high-level requirements down to development tasks.

4. FRD – Feature Requirements Document

A Feature Requirements Document (FRD) focuses on a specific product feature or set of related features, detailing the functional and non-functional needs of that feature. It can be seen as a subset of the PRD, zooming in on one feature area. An FRD ensures that each feature is thoroughly specified without cluttering the main PRD. It’s especially useful when a feature is complex or will be developed by a separate team. (Note: In some contexts, FRD may stand for Functional Requirements Document – the intent is similar: document feature-level requirements.)

Template Structure:
	•	Feature Overview – Name of the feature and a short description of its purpose and value. State which product or module it belongs to and its goal (e.g. “Feature: Mobile Payment Integration – enable users to pay via mobile wallets to improve checkout conversion”).
	•	Use Case Scenario – Briefly describe how and when the feature will be used from an end-user perspective (a narrative or use case). This provides context for the requirements.
	•	Functional Requirements – A detailed list of requirements specific to this feature. Structure these similarly to PRD feature requirements:
	•	List each requirement (FR-1, FR-2, etc.) as a statement of functionality or behavior. e.g., “FR-1: The system shall allow the user to add multiple payment methods.” Include details like field validations, business rules, etc. relevant to the feature.
	•	Provide Acceptance Criteria or examples for each requirement to ensure clarity (especially for edge cases). For instance, “If the payment fails, an error message with code is shown (see UX Design).” This aligns with best practices of making each requirement verifiable ￼.
	•	Data Requirements (if applicable) – If the feature involves data inputs/outputs or new data elements, specify them. E.g., “New database fields required” or “Data format for exporting reports.” This is essentially the Data Requirements Document portion narrowed to this feature.
	•	UI/Design Elements – Reference any specific UI components or design specifications critical to this feature. For example, if this feature introduces a new dialog or page, include a wireframe or reference to the UX Design Document section. This avoids duplicating the entire design doc but links to it (e.g. “See Wireframe in UXDD section 4 for layout of Payment screen”).
	•	Dependencies & Interactions – Note if this feature interacts with other features or systems. e.g., “Depends on user profile data (see FRD Profile Management)” or “API integration with Payment Gateway X is required”. This ensures integration points are known ￼.
	•	Non-Functional Requirements – Any performance, security, or compliance criteria specific to this feature. e.g., “Payment transactions must complete within 3 seconds on average” or “Comply with PCI-DSS standards ￼.” These ensure the feature’s special quality requirements are captured.
	•	Feature Acceptance – Define how to know if the feature is done. Summarize key acceptance criteria or sign-off conditions for the feature as a whole (especially if several sub-requirements must all pass).
	•	Open Issues – List any pending decisions or questions about the feature’s requirements. (e.g., “What happens if offline? – TBD”).

Justification: The FRD format is essentially a focused PRD for a single feature. It documents the specific capabilities that the feature must have ￼, ensuring no detail is overlooked at the feature level. Including use case context and UI references keeps the requirements tied to user needs (as recommended in feature specs). Acceptance criteria mirror those in PRDs to maintain testability ￼ ￼. By isolating feature-specific data and non-functional needs, the FRD clarifies any unique requirements without bloating broader documents.

Relationship to Other Documents: The FRD is usually derived from the Product Requirements Document – each major feature in the PRD could have an FRD providing deeper detail. It prevents the PRD from becoming too unwieldy by separating concerns. FRDs feed into the Technical Specification and Development user stories: engineers use them to design and implement the feature. They also inform the Test Plan for feature-specific test cases. By confining scope, FRDs avoid duplicating the entire PRD; they reference overarching info (like personas or global constraints) from the PRD, and defer detailed design to the UX Design Document or Design Requirements Document as needed. Essentially, the FRD ensures traceability from high-level requirement to low-level implementation for each feature (often tracked via a Traceability Matrix to map PRD -> FRD -> test cases).

5. Data Requirements Document (DRD)

The Data Requirements Document specifies the data needs of the project – what data must be captured, stored, processed, or output. It provides a detailed description of the data model and data elements needed to fulfill the functional requirements. This includes defining data entities, attributes, relationships, and any data quality or governance requirements. The DRD ensures engineers and database designers understand what data the system must handle (in terms of content and structure), independent of how it will be implemented in a database.

Template Structure:
	•	Introduction & Scope – Summarize the purpose of the DRD and the systems or modules it covers. For example, “This document defines data requirements for the Customer Management and Order Processing modules.” Mention if it is focusing on conceptual data needs (not physical design).
	•	Data Model Overview – Provide a high-level description of the data model or domain. List the main data entities (business objects) identified and how they conceptually relate ￼. Optionally include an ERD diagram at a conceptual level to visualize data relationships (entities and their connections).
	•	Entity Definitions – For each significant Entity (Object):
	•	Name & Description – e.g. “Customer – represents an end-user account in the system.” Define the meaning of the entity in business terms.
	•	Attributes – List each attribute the entity needs, with a description and data type/format. Include any constraints (e.g. “Email – string, must be unique and valid email format”). This aligns with capturing what data items are and their constraints ￼.
	•	Relationships – Describe key relationships to other entities (one-to-many, many-to-many etc.), but without design-level foreign key specifics. E.g. “A Customer can have multiple Orders (Customer –< Order).” Document cardinality and meaning of each relationship ￼ ￼.
	•	Data Dictionary – (Often integrated with above) A tabular data dictionary that compiles all entities and attributes:
	•	Field Name, Data Type, Allowed Values/Format, Description, Required?, Source (if from external system). This provides a concise reference of all data elements.
	•	Data Lifecycle & Volume – Note any requirements about data lifecycle:
	•	Retention and Archival – e.g. “Transaction records must be retained for 7 years” (compliance requirement).
	•	Volume & Growth – any known volume metrics affecting design (e.g. “System will store ~1M customer records initially, growing 10% yearly”).
	•	Data Quality & Governance Requirements – Describe any rules for data consistency or quality. E.g. “Each Order must have a valid CustomerID (no orphan orders) ￼.” Or “Follow ISO country codes for Location data.” Include any master data or reference data standards that must be adhered to.
	•	Security and Privacy Requirements – Specify classification of data and any privacy constraints. E.g., mark personal data fields and state encryption or access control needs (aligning with GDPR etc.). For example, “Encrypt sensitive fields like Password and Credit Card Number in storage and transit.” This ties to security standards but in context of data ￼.
	•	Integration Data Needs – If data is coming from or going to external systems, outline those interfaces at a data level. E.g. “Importing user profiles from CRM: mapping of CRM fields to system fields”. A mapping table could be used to show source-to-target field mappings ￼ ￼ (preventing misunderstandings during integration). This essentially captures data requirements for integration points.
	•	Assumptions & Notes – Document any assumptions about data (e.g. “Assume legacy data will be cleansed before migration”) and any additional notes (like unresolved data-related issues).

Justification: This template follows data modeling best practices and ensures all essential data questions (What entities? What attributes? What constraints?) are answered before design ￼. By listing data attributes and relationships, the DRD confirms a concise summary of all user and system data requirements ￼. It avoids specifying how the database is designed physically (that will be in the Database Schema Document), focusing instead on what data items exist and rules around them. Defining data retention, volume, and privacy needs aligns with ensuring non-functional data needs are captured early (to avoid later redesign) ￼ ￼. This document is particularly critical for aligning business analysts and database engineers on data definitions, and it complements functional requirements by ensuring the information to support those functions is well-specified.

Relationship to Other Documents: The Data Requirements Document connects closely with the Functional/Feature Requirements – it is derived from what data the features need. For instance, user profile features in the FRD will reference attributes defined in the DRD. The DRD informs the Database Schema Document (the actual database design) – by providing a conceptual model that the schema implements. It also guides the Data Flow Mapping (by clarifying data elements that flow) and the Data Migration Plan (by identifying what data fields must be migrated). By capturing data definitions here, we avoid duplicating detailed field lists in the SRS or design docs – those will simply reference the DRD or incorporate it by reference. Finally, data security requirements here will be echoed in the Design/Technical Spec and QA Plan (for testing data integrity and security).

6. UXSMD – UX Site Map Document

The UX Site Map Document (UXSMD) lays out the information architecture of the product’s user experience – essentially a site map of screens or pages and how they connect. It is a deliverable from the UX team that defines the structure of content and navigation. This document ensures that all stakeholders understand the navigational hierarchy and page taxonomy, and it serves as a blueprint for designing menus, user flows, and ensuring nothing is missed in development.

Template Structure:
	•	Site Map Overview – Brief intro explaining the context (web app, mobile app, etc.) and goals of the site map. Include any guiding principles (e.g. “Navigation should allow users to reach key pages in ≤3 clicks”).
	•	Top-Level Structure – Present the primary navigation categories or sections of the product. For example, list main menu sections or top-level screens (e.g., Home, Profile, Settings, etc.). If applicable, mention global navigation elements (search, help, etc.).
	•	Hierarchy Diagram – Include a site map diagram that visually shows the hierarchy of pages/screens. Use a tree or flowchart format: top-level pages branching into secondary pages, etc. ￼ ￼. Each node in the diagram is typically a page/screen name. For example:
	•	Dashboard
– Projects
– Reports
	•	Account
– Profile
– Billing
	•	(This is a text example; the actual document can embed a diagram graphic or use an indented list structure).
	•	Page List & Details – Provide a table or list of all pages/screens identified:
	•	Page Name – e.g. “Account Settings – Security”.
	•	Parent Section – e.g. “Account Settings (under Account)”.
	•	Purpose/Content Summary – one line on what the page contains or the user’s goal there (e.g. “Allows user to change password and 2FA settings”).
	•	URL or Identifier (for web, the URL path; for app, maybe a screen ID).
	•	Optionally Access/Navigation – how the user reaches this page (e.g. via Settings > Security).
	•	User Flows / Navigation Paths – Describe any important user journey flows through the site map. This could be a series of page transitions for key tasks. For example, “User Journey: Onboarding – Start at Welcome page > Sign Up > Profile Setup > Dashboard”. Use flow charts or numbered steps to illustrate. Include alternate paths if needed (like login vs. sign-up). Focus on flows that involve multiple sections of the site map ￼ ￼.
	•	Notes on Navigation Design – Provide any UX guidelines or notes:
	•	Menu Structure – e.g. “Main navigation menu will be a top bar with sections X, Y, Z”. Note if certain items are in a hamburger menu on mobile, etc.
	•	Utility Navigation – e.g. “Login/Logout and Help are in top-right corner globally (utility nav)” ￼.
	•	Page Relationships – If not obvious in diagram, explain cross-linking or related content. e.g. “From Project page, user can jump to related Reports”.
	•	Breadcumbs or Hierarchical Links – if to be used, indicate how pages link back up.
	•	Annotations per Page – (Optional but recommended) Provide additional context for each page if needed:
	•	Primary Goal/Call-to-Action on that page (why does it exist) ￼.
	•	Key Elements on the page (like if certain content must appear or be easily found).
	•	Next Step options (what typical page transitions are expected).
	•	This effectively is documenting “for each page, what is the user’s goal and main CTA” as recommended in UX guidelines ￼.
	•	Out-of-Scope & Future Pages – List any pages or sections explicitly decided to exclude or defer, to avoid ambiguity (e.g. “Admin panel pages are not included in this MVP site map.”). This prevents misunderstandings about hidden sections.

Justification: This structure follows IA best practices: start broad with main sections and gradually detail subpages. Visual sitemaps combined with page purpose descriptions help stakeholders quickly grasp the layout of content ￼ ￼. Documenting each page’s goal and CTA aligns with expert recommendations to ensure each page has a defined purpose and action ￼. Including user journeys (especially an example of how a user navigates through multiple pages to complete tasks) aligns the site map with actual UX flows, not just static hierarchy ￼. This template also calls out cross-linking and navigation patterns (like utility nav, breadcrumbs) that often are overlooked but critical to UX consistency ￼. By explicitly listing every page and its parent, we reduce the chance of missing content or duplicating pages.

Relationship to Other Documents: The UX Site Map Document is closely related to the UX Design Document and Wireframes. It is often created before detailed wireframes – serving as a blueprint for what screens need to be wireframed. The site map draws input from the Product Requirements/FRDs (which identify what functionality/pages are needed) and from any User Journeys defined in research. It prevents duplicate content between feature specs and design docs: feature PRDs might mention certain pages, but the UXSMD consolidates the structure in one place. It directly informs the Wireframe Template (ensuring all screens mapped here have corresponding wireframes) and guides developers when implementing navigation (thus linking to the Technical Spec for routing or menu implementation details). Changes in product scope (adding/removing a user-facing page) should be reflected in this site map, which then trickles down to design updates and possibly content in the Content Matrix (if used). In summary, the UXSMD ensures a shared understanding of the product’s structure, bridging high-level requirements and detailed UX design, without repeating content from those sources.

7. SRS – Software Requirements Specification

The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a comprehensive description of the system’s functional and non-functional requirements. It acts as a contract between stakeholders and developers, detailing exactly what the software must do and the conditions it must meet ￼ ￼. The SRS encompasses requirements from a system perspective, including inputs, outputs, behavior, interfaces, and qualities (performance, security, etc.). It often adheres to standards like IEEE 29148/830 to ensure completeness and clarity. The SRS is more technical and detailed than a PRD, serving as a foundation for design and testing.

Template Structure:
	•	Introduction – Explains purpose of the SRS and its scope. Includes:
	•	Purpose – A statement of the document’s intent (e.g. “Define all requirements for the Inventory Management System”).
	•	System Scope – What system or subsystem this SRS covers, and high-level system objectives.
	•	Definitions, Acronyms & References – Glossary of terms used (to avoid ambiguity) and references to related documents (vision doc, BRD, etc.) ￼.
	•	Overall Description – Provides context for the system:
	•	Product Perspective – The system’s context and how it fits in a bigger environment. E.g., state if it’s independent, part of a larger system, a replacement of existing system, etc. ￼. Include a high-level system block diagram or context diagram if helpful.
	•	Product Functions – Summary of major functions or features the system provides ￼. Think of this as a high-level list of capabilities (like modules or feature areas).
	•	User Classes & Characteristics – Identify types of users and their relevant needs/skill levels. E.g., “Admin users – technical staff; Regular users – general employees with minimal training.”
	•	Operating Environment – Platform constraints: hardware, OS, network, etc. (e.g. “Runs on Windows Server 2022, uses SQL Server DB, accessible via modern browsers”).
	•	Design & Implementation Constraints – Any technical constraints or standards (e.g. “Must be developed in Java”; “Follow XYZ encryption standard”) ￼.
	•	Assumptions & Dependencies – E.g., “Assumes internet connectivity; depends on third-party API for payments.”
	•	Specific Requirements – The detailed functional requirements and system features:
	•	Organize by modules or feature sets if large. For each function/feature:
	•	Description – What the feature is and its purpose.
	•	Stimulus/Response Sequence – Define how the system should react to specific inputs or events (could be use-case flows). For example, “On user login attempt (input credentials), the system validates against DB and returns success/failure message.”
	•	Functional Requirements – Enumerate requirements in a verifiable manner. Each requirement could be numbered (e.g. “REQ-1.2.3: The system shall encrypt user passwords using SHA-256 ￼.”). List all conditions, logic, and needed functionality. This should cover all inputs, outputs, data transformations, error handling for that function ￼ ￼. If using use cases, you may embed them here or in an appendix.
	•	Mock-ups or References – (Optional) If a UI is involved, reference the UX design or provide a simple mock for context, ensuring alignment between requirements and UI design.
	•	Cover every feature outlined in PRD/BRD, but in technical detail. Ensure to also include system interfaces: describe interactions with other systems or components (APIs, data feeds, etc.) as requirements.
	•	System Attributes (Non-Functional Requirements) – Specify all non-functional requirements:
	•	Performance – e.g. “System shall support 1000 concurrent users with response time < 2s for search queries”. List throughput, latency, capacity, etc. criteria ￼.
	•	Safety & Reliability – e.g. “System uptime 99.5% monthly; mean time to recovery < 1 hour.”
	•	Security – e.g. “User data in transit must be encrypted (TLS1.2); unauthorized access attempts shall lock the account after 5 tries”. Align with any standards (HIPAA, PCI) as applicable ￼.
	•	Maintainability & Flexibility – e.g. requirements on code modularity or configurability (often qualitative but can list standards to follow).
	•	Usability – any quantitative usability goals (if measurable) or adherence to UI standards (like “Follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA ￼.”).
	•	Other – Localization, legal/regulatory (like GDPR data erasure requirements), etc.
	•	External Interface Requirements – Detail interfaces the system has:
	•	User Interfaces – If relevant, describe characteristics of the UI (consistent with UX docs). Could reference a style guide or say “UI will be web-based, following corporate design system.”
	•	Hardware Interfaces – e.g. any device I/O, sensors, etc.
	•	Software Interfaces – APIs, databases, or other systems. For each, specify what data or services are exchanged (e.g. “Interfaces with Payment Gateway via REST API: must send X JSON payload and handle Y response ￼.”).
	•	Communication Interfaces – e.g. network protocols, message formats if any.
	•	Verification – (Optional, some SRS include this) Indicate for each requirement how it will be verified (inspection, test, analysis). This can be a simple tag (for traceability to the Test Plan).
	•	Appendices – Include supporting information:
	•	Use Case Details (if not embedded in main text).
	•	Data Requirements – You can reference the Data Requirements Document or include a data dictionary if short (to avoid duplicating DRD content).
	•	Traceability Matrix – Optionally, a mapping of requirements back to business needs (or forward to test cases). This ensures each BRD item is covered ￼ ￼.

Justification: This SRS structure covers all IEEE-recommended sections ￼ ￼, ensuring completeness. The introduction and overall description provide context so developers understand the environment and users before diving into specifics ￼ ￼. Breaking out specific requirements by feature (or use case) followed by comprehensive non-functional requirements matches industry templates ￼ ￼. Including interface specs and external interactions prevents gaps when integrating modules ￼. The explicit non-functional requirements section is crucial – many failures occur if performance, security, etc., are not clearly defined ￼. By listing them, we set clear acceptance criteria beyond functionality. Traceability and verification are mentioned to align with quality management – ensuring every requirement can be tested and traced ￼.

Relationship to Other Documents: The SRS consolidates requirements from various sources (Vision, BRD, PRD, DRD) into one master specification. It often overlaps with content in the PRD and FRDs but with a more technical angle and full detail. To avoid duplication, the SRS can reference the Data Requirements Document for detailed data schemas, or include them as an appendix rather than rewriting. The SRS is the basis for the Design Requirements Document and Technical Specification – those will take each requirement here and propose a design solution. It also directly informs the Test Plan: the QA team will develop tests to verify each SRS requirement (hence traceability matrices connecting SRS requirements to test cases ￼). In summary, the SRS is the single source of truth of what the software must do, ensuring all stakeholder and regulatory needs captured in earlier docs are formalized. By maintaining references (rather than copying content) for things like data definitions or user persona context, it stays consistent with those documents without redundancy.

8. BRD (Backend Requirements Document)

The Backend Requirements Document specifies requirements for the backend system or server-side components of the product. (Note: BRD here is distinct from Business Requirements Doc; in this context, it refers to Back-end.) It focuses on the technical and functional needs of the server side – such as APIs, databases, integrations, and business logic that must be implemented on the backend. Essentially, it is a subset of the overall SRS/Technical Spec, isolating the requirements that concern the backend architecture and services. This document is useful in projects where frontend and backend are developed separately, ensuring backend developers have a clear spec of what to build.

Template Structure:
	•	Introduction & Scope – Clarify that this document addresses backend system requirements. Define what subsystems or services are considered “backend” here (e.g. “This document covers server-side components of the e-commerce system – including the application server, database, and external service integrations.”). Note assumptions such as client-side handled by a separate team.
	•	Backend Context – Provide a high-level diagram or description of the backend architecture context. For example, illustrate the backend components (web server, database, third-party systems) and how they connect. E.g. “The backend exposes REST APIs to the frontend and communicates with Payment Gateway and CRM via SOAP APIs.” This sets the stage for requirements by framing environment and tech stack.
	•	Functional Requirements (Backend Services) – Detail the server-side functionalities:
	•	For each API endpoint or backend service method, specify requirements. e.g. “API: POST /api/orders – creates a new order in the system.” Then list what the backend must do:
	•	Inputs & Processing – e.g. validate input data, apply business rules (inventory check, pricing logic).
	•	Data Storage – e.g. “Save order to Orders table with status=Pending.”
	•	Outputs/Response – e.g. “Return order ID and summary in JSON on success; appropriate error codes on failure.”
	•	These essentially mirror functional requirements but focused on backend logic and data handling.
	•	Cover all key backend functions (authentication, data retrieval, etc.) that maybe were mentioned as PRD features but here describe how backend handles them. For example, for a “Reset Password” feature, backend requirement might be “Generate a secure token, store it, email the link via SMTP”.
	•	Business Logic Requirements – Document specific business rules enforced by backend:
	•	E.g. “Discount calculation: backend shall calculate applicable discounts based on user type and order amount following rule X…”.
	•	“The system shall not allow an order > $10,000 without manager approval.”
	•	These rules ensure the backend enforces any constraints regardless of frontend.
	•	Data Management Requirements – Anything related to data that backend handles:
	•	Database – Outline requirements for database interactions the backend must support. E.g., “The backend shall maintain referential integrity between Customers and Orders (no orphan records)”. Mention any triggers or batch processes required (like scheduled jobs, e.g. “Every night at 12AM, backend job archives logs older than 30 days.”).
	•	Caching – If performance caching is expected, define it: “Frequently accessed data (product catalog) should be cached in memory with TTL of 5 minutes to meet performance targets.”
	•	Transactions – e.g. “Backend must perform operations on accounts and orders in a single ACID transaction to ensure consistency.”
	•	Integration Requirements – Define how backend interacts with external systems:
	•	For each integration (third-party API, legacy system, message queue), specify requirements: “Integrate with Payment Gateway: backend must call PayCo API for payment processing using REST, handle timeouts within 30s, and retry up to 2 times ￼ ￼.”
	•	“Receive webhooks from Supplier System on /api/webhook/supply, validate signature, and update stock.”
	•	If applicable, specify data mapping or transformation in integration (though details could refer to Data Mapping doc).
	•	Security & Access Control – Backend-specific security requirements:
	•	“All backend API endpoints must require a valid OAuth 2.0 token for authentication.”
	•	“Implement role-based access checks: e.g., only Admin role can access /api/users/list.”
	•	“Sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS ￼.”
	•	Include audit logging requirements: “Backend shall log authentication attempts and data changes with user ID and timestamp.”
	•	Performance & Scalability (server-side) – Requirements like:
	•	“Backend API should handle 100 requests per second with average latency < 200ms.”
	•	“Design backend to be stateless to allow horizontal scaling across at least 4 instances.”
	•	“Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks to not block request threads.”
	•	DevOps/Deployment Requirements – If relevant, specify any requirements for how backend is built or deployed:
	•	“Must run in Docker containers for deployment; externalize all config.”
	•	“Support blue-green deployment strategy for zero downtime releases.” (This could also be in Deployment Strategy doc, but listing key requirements here ensures backend design accounts for it.)
	•	Non-functional Qualities – Summarize other qualities:
	•	Reliability (e.g., “Implement database connection pooling and graceful error handling to avoid crashes.”).
	•	Maintainability (perhaps coding standard or modular design expectations).
	•	Any specific compliance (like “All data at rest in backend DB must be encrypted per AES-256 standard.” which is both security and compliance).
	•	Appendices (Optional):
	•	API Spec Appendix – You might attach a structured list of all API endpoints with their request/response schemas (like an OpenAPI summary) for completeness.
	•	Error Codes – A table of backend error codes and meanings if many exist.

Justification: This template isolates backend requirements that might otherwise be scattered in an SRS or technical design. By focusing on APIs, data, and integrations, it ensures the backend team knows exactly what to implement. We enumerate functional requirements in terms of backend services (APIs, jobs) rather than UI – this aligns with Atlassian’s note that feature requirements document the specific capabilities while technical specs define technologies ￼. The emphasis on security, transactions, and performance is crucial – backend systems often have these as key requirements and listing them explicitly ensures they are not assumed. Integration requirements are given specific attention since backend often has the burden of external communication – here we specify protocols, timing, retries, etc., which are common pitfalls if not defined ￼ ￼. This structured approach prevents duplication by not repeating general product requirements; instead, it takes those and addresses the backend’s role in fulfilling them.

Relationship to Other Documents: The Backend Requirements Document is essentially a more technical extension of the SRS/Technical Spec, focusing on server-side. It should be consistent with the system-wide SRS – e.g., any requirement in the SRS that involves server logic should appear here with implementation detail. It draws from the Product/Feature Requirements (what needs to happen) and translates them into backend actions (how the server will provide that). It is closely tied to the Database Requirements Document and Database Schema – the backend will meet many requirements via database operations, so cross-reference the data model when listing entities or constraints to avoid conflicting definitions. It also informs the Integration Plan and Deployment Strategy: e.g., if the backend must support a certain deployment or integration approach, that requirement is captured here and then a plan is made in those documents. In Agile practice, much of this might be captured in user stories with technical subtasks; however, the Backend Requirements Doc provides a comprehensive view for architecture decisions and test planning. To avoid redundancy, front-end (UI) behavior is not detailed here – that belongs in the UX Design Doc or a Frontend spec – only validations or flows enforced by backend are mentioned (ensuring one source of truth for each aspect). In summary, this document ensures the backend team implements everything needed for the product to function and meet quality goals, in alignment with system and business requirements but without repeating the entire SRS.

9. DBRD – Database Requirements Document

The Database Requirements Document (DBRD) outlines the requirements for the database and data storage layer of the system. It translates data requirements into a blueprint for the database design, specifying how data will be structured, stored, and accessed. This includes describing tables (or collections), keys, and relationships, as well as performance, scalability, and security requirements specific to the database. Essentially, if the Data Requirements Document defined what data is needed conceptually, the DBRD defines what the database must support to meet those needs – acting as a precursor to creating the actual database schema.

Template Structure:
	•	Introduction – State the purpose of this document (to define database-specific requirements) and the scope (which databases or data stores it covers). E.g., “This document covers requirements for the primary SQL database storing customer, order, and product data.”
	•	Database System & Constraints – Specify if there are any chosen DBMS or storage technology and related constraints. E.g., “The system will use PostgreSQL 15 – requirements assume a relational model.” Or if multiple data stores (SQL, NoSQL) are involved, clarify each’s role.
	•	Schema Requirements (Logical Data Model) – For each entity from the data requirements:
	•	Proposed Table (or Collection) Name – e.g., Customer, Order, etc.
	•	Columns/Fields – list each field, with intended data type, size, and constraints:
	•	“customer_id – integer, primary key, auto-increment.”
	•	“email – varchar(255), unique, not null.”
	•	“created_at – datetime, default current timestamp.”
	•	Include Keys:
	•	Primary Key for each table (and whether auto-generated).
	•	Foreign Keys and references (e.g., “Order.customer_id -> Customer.customer_id (many orders per customer)”) including cardinality ￼.
	•	Indexes – any specific indexing requirements for performance: “Index on Order.created_at for sorting recent orders.” If known, list which fields need indexes beyond PK/FK.
	•	This essentially converts conceptual data attributes into a database schema format, ensuring normalization or any denormalization is deliberate.
	•	Relational Integrity & Constraints – Detail any referential integrity requirements:
	•	“Deleting a Customer shall either restrict if orders exist (no cascade delete), to prevent orphan orders.” ￼.
	•	“Order.total = sum of related OrderLine amounts – enforce via trigger or application logic.” (If complex constraints, note if the DB should enforce it or if app does).
	•	Any check constraints (like “age >= 18”) if applicable.
	•	Data Volume & Partitioning – Specify if large tables need special handling:
	•	“Transaction table expected to grow to 10 million rows/year. The database must support partitioning the Transaction table by year to aid in maintenance and querying.”
	•	“The design should accommodate archiving of records older than 2 years to an archive table or database.”
	•	Performance Requirements – Requirements for query performance that database design must fulfill:
	•	“Queries filtering by customer_id and order_date should retrieve results within 1 second for a dataset of 1 million orders.”
	•	“The database must handle 100 concurrent read/write operations without deadlock or degradation.”
	•	These help in deciding indexing, caching, or sharding strategies.
	•	Scalability & High Availability – If relevant:
	•	“Must support replication to a read replica for scaling reads.”
	•	“Design for horizontal sharding by region if user base grows beyond 10 million (no immediate requirement, but design should not preclude it).”
	•	“Backup and recovery: the system shall provide full daily backups and point-in-time recovery.” (This could also be in a deployment/ops doc, but including here ensures the design accounts for it).
	•	Security Requirements (DB-specific):
	•	“Encrypt sensitive fields at rest in the database (e.g., SSN, Password) using column-level encryption or application-level encryption.”
	•	“Database must support role-based access: e.g., a read-only account for reporting, full-access for app.”
	•	“Follow SQL injection prevention standards – all queries parameterized.” (Largely an app concern, but if any stored procedures or direct queries, mention).
	•	If using GDPR or compliance, mention any “Right to be forgotten: database must permanently delete personal data fields when requested”.
	•	Migration & Integration – If relevant, requirements for migrating data from an old system or integrating:
	•	“Provide migration scripts or ETL for importing legacy customer data; must validate data conforms to new schema (as per mapping in Data Requirements Document).”
	•	“Support data import/export in CSV for integration with Data Warehouse (include all necessary fields).”
	•	DBMS Features Utilization – Note if using any specific DB features:
	•	“Use DBMS’s full-text search on product.description to enable search feature.”
	•	“Use stored procedures for complex commission calculation for performance, unless otherwise decided.”
	•	If certain features are disallowed or discouraged (maybe to keep logic in app), note that too.
	•	Maintenance & Growth – E.g., “The database should be able to be optimized (reindexed) without downtime; maintenance operations must be planned.” or “Plan for partitioning as data grows annually as described.”
	•	Appendices – Potential supporting info:
	•	ER Diagrams (logical and/or proposed physical ERD).
	•	Data Dictionary (could be main content or appendix – listing tables/columns as above).
	•	Sample Data if needed to illustrate structure (small examples of records).
	•	Legacy-to-New Mapping table if migrating data from old schema.

Justification: This template ensures we cover everything needed for designing a robust database that meets system needs. It essentially formalizes a database design specification, including all schema elements (tables, fields, keys) – this comes from transforming the conceptual model from the Data Requirements Document into a logical design ￼ ￼. Listing integrity constraints and keys is critical to maintain data quality in the implemented database (as emphasized by data modeling best practices). Performance and volume considerations ensure the design is forward-looking and can handle growth (per recommendations to estimate capacity early ￼ ￼). Security and compliance requirements ensure the database design includes necessary protections (like encryption, access control) rather than being retrofit later ￼. By including diagrams and data dictionary, we provide clear communication to developers and DBAs. This DBRD overlaps with content from the DRD and SRS but focuses specifically on how to implement the data storage; referencing the DRD’s definitions in the process prevents inconsistencies.

Relationship to Other Documents: The DBRD directly builds on the Data Requirements Document – all entities and fields in the DRD should appear here with concrete types and keys. It serves as a precursor to the Database Schema Document (which might be an actual DDL or final design artifact). Essentially, the DBRD is to the database what the Technical Spec is to the application logic. It must align with the Backend Requirements (e.g., if backend requires certain queries, the database design must support them with indexes or structure). It also informs the Data Flow Mapping and Migration Checklist – e.g., the migration plan will use the new schema defined here as the target structure. By capturing database-specific needs here, the overall SRS/Tech Spec can reference this instead of containing overwhelming schema detail. The QA Plan will also use this document to plan database testing (for data integrity, performance under load, etc.). In summary, the DBRD ensures that when the system is built, the database is not a black box – it’s explicitly designed to meet all requirements, and everything from data model to indexing is documented and agreed upon, reducing the risk of missing a constraint or key that could cause failures down the line.

10. DRD – Design Requirements Document (Design Spec)

The Design Requirements Document (DRD) – here referring to Design as in UI/UX or system design – outlines the requirements for the design aspect of the project. (Note: To avoid confusion, we’ll call it the Design Spec.) It translates requirements into a proposed solution structure, guiding how the system will be designed to meet them. This can encompass UI/UX design requirements (visual and interaction guidelines) and/or system architectural design constraints. In many cases, this document is more of a Solution Design Document, describing how the requirements will be realized in design. Given the context of other templates (UXDD, Technical Spec), we interpret this DRD as focusing on UI/UX Design requirements – i.e., what the design must achieve (since technical design likely covered elsewhere).

Template Structure:
	•	Introduction – State what aspect of design this document addresses. For instance, “This Design Requirements Document specifies the UX design requirements and guidelines for the ABC Product, ensuring consistency and adherence to user needs.” Mention any design frameworks or branding standards it must align with.
	•	Guiding Design Principles – List any agreed high-level principles the design should follow:
	•	e.g. “Simplicity – minimize cognitive load (3-click rule) ￼.”
	•	“Consistency – use standard UI patterns across modules.”
	•	“Accessibility – conform to WCAG 2.1 AA in all screens.”
	•	“Mobile-first – design for small screens and scale up.”
	•	These ensure the design aligns with best practices and company or project philosophy.
	•	Visual Style Requirements – Outline requirements around the visual design:
	•	Branding – e.g. “Use corporate color palette (#112233 primary, #445566 secondary) and approved fonts (Arial for text, etc.) in all UI”. Link to a style guide if available rather than duplicating it.
	•	Layout & Responsiveness – “The layout must be responsive for desktop and mobile: on mobile, components stack vertically”. If grid systems or breakpoints are defined, list them (e.g., “Use 12-column grid on desktop, 4-column on mobile”).
	•	Typography & Iconography – any requirements like “Headings use Font X at 24px; body text 16px for readability”, “Icons from Material Design set, consistent stroke width”.
	•	Imagery – if any specific requirements: “User avatars displayed at 40px circle; product images max 600px width”.
	•	Component/Pattern Requirements – Define the key UI components or design patterns that must be present or standardized:
	•	e.g. “Navigation menu appears persistently at top (for desktop) or as a hamburger drawer (for mobile) per site map ￼.”
	•	“Use breadcrumb navigation on pages deeper than 2 levels to show context ￼.”
	•	“Forms: all mandatory fields labeled with * and validation messages shown inline in red text.”
	•	“Buttons: primary actions in blue filled button, secondary in outline style.”
	•	If a design system is in use, reference it (like “Follow Carbon Design System components for all UI controls”).
	•	Interaction Requirements – What the UX must accommodate in terms of interactions:
	•	Accessibility – “All interactive elements must be usable via keyboard (tab navigation) and have ARIA labels ￼.” Also mention contrast requirements, focus states, etc.
	•	Feedback & States – “User actions should provide immediate feedback: e.g., clicking ‘Save’ shows a success toast within 2 seconds.” Define loading indicators (e.g., “Use a spinner icon after form submit until response received”), error states (like inline error messages, as above).
	•	Responsive Behavior – “On small screens, menu collapses; tables turn into cards or horizontal scroll.” These ensure the design accounts for various devices.
	•	Animations (if any) – e.g. “Modal dialogs fade in within 200ms; use easing-out animation.” Or “Avoid excessive motion; any animation must be under 0.5s.”
	•	Page-Level Requirements – If certain pages have specific design needs not covered by global patterns, list them:
	•	E.g. “Dashboard page will have an interactive chart – must allow zooming and panning.”
	•	“Login page design should include company logo and a two-column layout with marketing info on the right on desktop, collapsing to one column on mobile.”
	•	Essentially any special requirements per screen beyond basic patterns.
	•	Design Dependencies – Note any dependencies on third-party libraries or design assets:
	•	“Using FontAwesome for icons – ensure license compliance.”
	•	“Using Bootstrap 5 grid – align custom components to its spacing system.”
	•	Acceptance Criteria for Design – Define how we know the design meets requirements:
	•	“Conduct usability testing with at least 5 users; all must be able to complete key tasks without external help (success criteria).” (This ties design to user research outcomes.)
	•	“Stakeholder sign-off on style guide and key screen mockups.”
	•	“Accessibility audit passes WCAG AA level (e.g., via Lighthouse score >= 90).”
	•	Appendices/References – Link or include:
	•	Style Guide / UI Kit – maybe not written out, but ensure reference to where fonts, colors, etc., are defined (or attach as appendix).
	•	Hi-fi Mockups or Screenshots – could embed or attach a few key approved mockups as examples of the required design style.
	•	User Persona/Research Summary – optionally include a brief from UX research that influenced design (to justify certain choices).
	•	UX Flows – if not elsewhere, perhaps include diagrams of user flows highlighting design decision points.

Justification: The Design Requirements Document as structured ensures that the design team’s output meets both user needs and branding/usability standards. It reads like a “design brief” combined with a style guide summary. Including guiding principles aligns the team on overarching goals (which sources suggest is key for UX consistency) ￼. Visual style and component standardization reduce subjective debates and ensure consistency across the UI (as recommended by design system best practices). Interaction requirements like accessibility and responsive behavior are critical and often explicitly required by law or policy – listing them here ensures they are considered from the start ￼. Essentially, this document prevents the scenario where a visually appealing design fails basic usability or branding guidelines by stating those requirements upfront.

Relationship to Other Documents: The Design Requirements Document ties closely with the UX Design Document (UXDD) and Wireframes. The UXDD will contain the actual design solutions (mockups, prototypes), and this DRD provides the requirements and criteria those designs must fulfill. It references the Product Requirements (for context on what needs to be designed) and Persona/Journey documents (ensuring design serves those users and flows). It avoids duplication by not re-listing all UX deliverables; instead it sets rules that apply across them. For example, rather than showing every screen’s mockup (which is UXDD’s job), it states common patterns like navigation, color usage, etc. It also complements the Technical Spec: where the tech spec might say “use React and Material-UI for front-end,” this design spec says “customize Material-UI to match our brand: primary color = blue etc.” It ensures developers know how to implement the UI to meet design standards (thus bridging design and development). The QA Plan may use this document to write UI test cases (e.g., checking if certain pages follow accessibility rules or if error messages appear as specified). In summary, the Design Requirements Document ensures that the eventual UX/UI meets the intended experience quality and is consistent, accessible, and aligned with business identity, without rewriting all the design details found in the UX design deliverables.

11. Database Schema Document

The Database Schema Document describes the actual database schema design in detail, effectively turning the requirements into a concrete model. It typically includes the finalized ER diagram and definitions of each table, column, keys, and relationships in the implemented database. This document is often the output of the database design phase and serves as reference for developers, DBAs, and testers to understand the structure of stored data. It is closely related to (and likely derived from) the Database Requirements (DBRD), but is more formal and possibly includes physical details like indexing, data types, and any SQL DDL statements.

Template Structure:
	•	Database Overview – Brief intro stating which database or data store this schema pertains to (e.g., “Relational schema for ABC System main operational database using MySQL”). Mention if it’s a new schema or modifications to an existing one, and the version if applicable.
	•	ER Diagram – Present the Entity-Relationship diagram for the database. This diagram should depict all tables (entities), their columns (attributes), primary keys, and relationships (with cardinalities). The diagram visually communicates the schema structure at a high level ￼ ￼. Embed the ERD image or use text-based notation if needed. Ensure relationships (foreign keys) are clearly labeled (one-to-many, etc.).
	•	Schema Details (By Table): For each table in the schema:
	•	Table Name – e.g., CUSTOMER, ORDER, use naming conventions (often uppercase or lowercase underscores).
	•	Purpose – A one-liner describing what the table represents (for context). e.g., “Stores customer account info.”
	•	Columns – List every column with:
	•	Name (and maybe column alias if any abbreviation used).
	•	Data Type (including length, precision if applicable, e.g. VARCHAR(100), INT, DECIMAL(10,2), DATE).
	•	Constraints:
	•	PK if it’s part of primary key.
	•	FK if it’s a foreign key (specify reference table.column).
	•	Not Null / Allow Null.
	•	Unique if applicable.
	•	Default value if any.
	•	Check constraints if any (e.g., CHECK (quantity > 0)).
	•	Description: short description of what data it holds ￼. For example: quantity INT NOT NULL – number of product units in the order.
	•	Example:

CUSTOMER Table:
 - customer_id (INT, PK, auto-increment) – unique ID for each customer.
 - email (VARCHAR(255), unique, NOT NULL) – login email.
 - name (VARCHAR(100), NULL) – full name of customer.
 - created_at (DATETIME, NOT NULL, default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) – registration timestamp.


	•	Primary Key – Identify the primary key column(s) explicitly if not obvious (e.g., “Primary Key: customer_id”).
	•	Foreign Keys – List foreign key constraints: e.g., “FK_order_customer: (customer_id) references CUSTOMER(customer_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT”. Include actions (restrict, cascade) as per design ￼.
	•	Indexes – List any indexes on this table beyond the PK (which is usually indexed automatically). E.g., “INDEX idx_order_date on ORDER(order_date)” for performance of date queries.
	•	Other Constraints/Triggers – e.g., mention if there’s a unique composite key, or a trigger (like “TRIGGER trg_update_stock AFTER INSERT on ORDER_LINE – updates PRODUCT stock_qty” if that’s part of design).

	•	Relationship Definitions – It might be redundant with FK list, but you can summarize:
	•	e.g., “One CUSTOMER can have many ORDERs (1-to-N, enforced by FK_order_customer).”
	•	“Each ORDER has many ORDER_LINEs; an ORDER_LINE links one PRODUCT (FK_orderline_product).”
	•	This textual explanation ensures readers understand cardinalities easily ￼.
	•	Schema Diagram of Relationships (optional if ERD is already given with cardinalities).
	•	Physical Implementation Notes – Any specifics about how schema is implemented:
	•	Partitioning or clustering if used (e.g., “EVENT table is partitioned by year for performance”).
	•	Storage engine or tablespace notes if relevant (e.g., “Using InnoDB for all tables for transactional support.”).
	•	If large text or binary data is stored, note any special handling (like storing in separate table).
	•	Security & Permissions – Note any schema-level security:
	•	e.g., “Sensitive data like PASSWORD in USER table is hashed; no clear text stored.”
	•	“A DB user ‘app_readonly’ has SELECT on all tables for reporting; all write operations through ‘app_user’ account.”
	•	Or “Use VIEWs to restrict columns for certain operations (e.g., a view excluding salary field for general access).”
	•	Changes from Previous Schema (if applicable) – If this is version 2 or migrating from old, list major differences:
	•	e.g., “Removed column X from CUSTOMER; normalized address into new ADDRESS table.”
	•	This helps during migration and for understanding upgrade impact.
	•	Appendices:
	•	DDL Scripts – Optionally include or attach the actual SQL DDL statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER statements). This can be an authoritative reference – sometimes teams attach the SQL create script as the schema doc itself.
	•	Sample Data – If useful, show a few example records in key tables to illustrate relationships.
	•	Reference Data – List static/reference tables and their entries (e.g., list of Countries if there’s a COUNTRY table).
	•	Glossary – If any database naming conventions or abbreviations are non-obvious, define them (e.g., qty = quantity).

Justification: This Schema Document is essentially the output of database design – it is structured to be extremely clear on every table and field. Documenting each field’s type and constraints is crucial to avoid misunderstandings and to assist developers writing queries or interacting with the database ￼ ￼. Including foreign key relationships and index info ensures that performance and integrity considerations captured in requirements are indeed implemented. It aligns with IEEE documentation advice to provide formal descriptions of data structures ￼. By providing DDL or diagrams, it serves as a single source of truth for the database, which testers and developers can rely on (for writing correct SQL, for example). The level of detail in constraints (like ON DELETE rules) explicitly captures decisions made (e.g., whether deleting a customer cascades or not), preventing errors or assumptions later.

Relationship to Other Documents: This document is the concrete realization of the Database Requirements (DBRD). Each requirement in the DBRD (e.g., “ensure no orphan orders exist” ￼) should be reflected here (via a foreign key with ON DELETE RESTRICT in the schema). It should stay consistent with the Data Requirements Document and Data Flow mappings – e.g., if DRD said an attribute exists, it must appear in the schema. If there’s a discrepancy, that’s an issue to reconcile. This schema is used by developers (in coding data access and migrations) and by the Migration Checklist (to map old to new schema). It informs the Integration Plan (how external data populates these tables). It heavily influences the Test Plan: the QA team may do database verification testing, requiring this as a reference for writing SQL tests or verifying schema compliance. By not repeating explanation of the data model in multiple places, we avoid duplication – earlier docs (like DRD) explained what data is and why; this schema doc sets how it’s structured physically. In some processes, the SRS or Technical Design might contain the schema inline – but separating it allows database specialists to focus on this and update without affecting other parts of the spec. The Schema Document should be kept updated with any schema changes (version control) and thus serves as the main reference for the team’s understanding of stored data structure.

12. ORM Document

The ORM Document details the mapping between the object-oriented domain models in the application code and the relational database schema (if using an Object-Relational Mapping layer), or generally how data entities are represented in code. Essentially, it’s a model mapping specification – for each class or data entity in the code, how it corresponds to database tables and relationships. This is useful for ensuring the development team understands how the persistence layer is structured, and it keeps the code’s domain model consistent with the database design. If using an ORM framework (like Hibernate, Entity Framework, Sequelize, etc.), this document can capture the configuration of that ORM.

Template Structure:
	•	Introduction – State which ORM or data mapping approach is used (e.g., “We use Hibernate (Java) as the ORM to map Java domain objects to the PostgreSQL schema.”). Mention purpose: to define the object-relational mapping so that code and DB stay in sync.
	•	ORM Framework Conventions – If any conventions or base configurations apply, note them:
	•	e.g., “All entity classes are in package com.abc.model. We use JPA annotations to define mappings. Naming convention: Class names singular (Customer) map to table of same name in uppercase (CUSTOMER).”
	•	“We use Lombok for getters/setters but will show fields for clarity.”
	•	Class-to-Table Mappings – For each persistent domain class:
	•	Class Name – e.g., Customer class.
	•	Mapped Table – e.g., CUSTOMER table.
	•	Field-to-Column Mapping – list each persistent field and which column it maps to:
	•	e.g., private Long id; -> customer_id (PK, auto-generated).
	•	private String email; -> email (unique).
	•	If naming differs significantly, highlight (if using annotations like @Column(name="..."), list that explicitly).
	•	Primary Key – note which field is the primary key and how generated (e.g., “id -> customer_id: uses @Id with auto-generated strategy (IDENTITY)”).
	•	Relationships (Associations) – for associations to other classes:
	•	e.g., private List<Order> orders; in Customer class -> maps to ORDER table foreign key customer_id ￼.
	•	Specify mapping type: “OneToMany: Customer.orders mapped by Order.customer” with fetch type (lazy/eager) if relevant.
	•	private Customer customer; in Order class -> customer_id FK in ORDER table (ManyToOne).
	•	If ManyToMany or OneToOne, detail the join table or shared PK as needed.
	•	Essentially mirror the ER relationships but in OOP terms (using ORM annotation terms like OneToMany, ManyToOne, etc., if using JPA).
	•	Inheritance or Polymorphism – If any classes inherit and have special mapping (e.g., single-table or joined subclasses), describe those ORM strategies.
	•	Cascade and Orphan Removal – note cascade settings on relationships if any (e.g., “orders in Customer: CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval=true to cascade persistence operations to orders.”).
	•	Value Object Embeddings – if using embedded types or complex types, describe mapping (e.g., “Address (street,city) is @Embeddable mapped into CUSTOMER table columns (street, city).”).
	•	Repository/DAO Structure – (If applicable) describe how data access is organized in code:
	•	e.g., “We use Spring Data JPA Repositories for each aggregate root: CustomerRepository, OrderRepository provide CRUD and query methods.”
	•	Or “Custom DAO classes handle complex queries using QueryDSL.” (Focus is on mapping, but giving context of how it’s used can help understanding.)
	•	Mapping Rules & Constraints – Note any notable differences or rules:
	•	“All date-time fields in DB (TIMESTAMP) map to Java LocalDateTime via JPA @Temporal.”
	•	“Enum fields: Status enum stored as VARCHAR in DB (use @Enumerated(STRING)).”
	•	“Large text (CLOB) fields map to String annotated with @Lob.”
	•	If any field is not persisted or computed, note with @Transient.
	•	Database Constraints in ORM – mention if/how the ORM layer ensures certain constraints:
	•	“Unique constraints: email field has @Column(unique=true) which will generate a DB unique constraint.”
	•	If using any ORM-level validation or hooks, e.g., “Use Hibernate Validator annotations like @NotNull, which the ORM will enforce on flush.”
	•	Example Mapping Snippets – You may include a code snippet example for one class:

@Entity  
@Table(name="CUSTOMER")  
public class Customer {  
    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy=IDENTITY)  
    @Column(name="customer_id")  
    private Long id;
    @Column(name="email", nullable=false, unique=true)
    private String email;
    ...
    @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer", cascade=ALL, orphanRemoval=true)
    private List<Order> orders;
    ...
}

This demonstrates how the written details look in code.

	•	Transaction & Session Management – Clarify if needed:
	•	e.g., “Service layer methods are annotated @Transactional, committing via ORM at end.”
	•	Or “We use OpenSessionInView: Session is open through request for lazy loading.” (This helps QA or devs know how lazy relations will work).
	•	Performance Considerations – Note any mapping decisions made for performance:
	•	“The orders collection is marked LAZY to avoid loading all orders when a customer is fetched.”
	•	“Batch fetch size set to 10 for Order->OrderLine to mitigate N+1 selects.”
	•	“Second-level cache enabled for Product entities using EhCache.”
	•	Link to Schema – Perhaps include a cross-reference table linking class.field to Table.column (some of which already done above). This ensures traceability – e.g., someone looking at a DB column can find which object it’s in.
	•	Migration or Framework Config – If relevant, note how ORM mapping is applied:
	•	e.g., “Mapping files: Hibernate XML mapping files located in resources/orm/ or “Auto DDL: The ORM is configured to auto-generate schema on startup” vs manual migration scripts.
	•	If auto-generation, ensure it aligns with the actual schema doc (maybe verifying that the ORM generation matches the schema doc).
	•	Appendices:
	•	If using XML mapping (older style), you could include the mapping XML files as reference.
	•	If any special type converters (like converting between DB types and custom objects), document those.

Justification: This ORM Document ensures that the team has a clear understanding of how the code’s object model corresponds to the database structure. It prevents misalignment where code might not uphold the same relationships or constraints as the DB (for instance, forgetting to handle a cascade delete in code). By listing each class-to-table mapping and field mapping, it serves as a “traceability matrix” between code and DB ￼ ￼. It’s informed by the principle that every persistent class should reflect a real data entity ￼ – here we explicitly tie them. Mentioning things like lazy vs eager fetch and cascade rules addresses common pitfalls in ORM usage (like accidentally loading too much data or not cascading deletes), thus these are called out as requirements or decisions. It also complements the Schema Document: the schema doc is DB-centric, this is code-centric, but both describe the same structure. Ensuring consistency between them (which this document does by referencing table and column names exactly) is crucial – e.g., if the schema doc says CUSTOMER table with customer_id, the ORM doc shows @Table(name="CUSTOMER") and @Column(customer_id) for the id field.

Relationship to Other Documents: The ORM Document ties the Database Schema Document and the Application Code together. It is effectively derived from the Schema Document – for every table/column, there should be a class/field mapping here (unless some tables are not directly mapped to objects). It should not introduce new data that aren’t in the schema, preventing duplication: instead it references the schema for types and constraints, just showing how they appear in code. It assists the Technical Specification or Implementation Plan by detailing how data layer is implemented. For example, if the technical spec said “use ORM to abstract persistence”, this document is the concrete mapping. It also informs the QA Plan: testers might need to create test objects and verify they persist correctly – understanding the mapping helps them write tests (like “creating a Customer object should result in a row in CUSTOMER table”). Additionally, it helps during Migration or integration: if data migration scripts need to populate objects via code or directly in DB, they can use this as reference to ensure the fields line up. It prevents duplicate effort by not restating all schema info in the technical design narrative: instead, that doc might simply say “see ORM Document for class mappings” or include a brief summary. In an agile project, this might be maintained as part of developer documentation rather than formal, but having it written ensures new developers quickly understand model <-> table alignment without reading every annotation in code. Thus, the ORM Document maintains consistency between the evolving codebase and the fixed database design, aligning both with the initial requirements.

13. UXDD – UX Design Document

The UX Design Document (UXDD) captures the user experience design of the product in detail. It includes the wireframes, prototypes, user flows, and design rationale for the UI. Essentially, it is the blueprint of the user interface and interaction design that developers and stakeholders reference during implementation. Where the Product/Feature requirements define what needs to be built, the UXDD shows how it should look and behave for the user. This document ensures that the final product’s UI aligns with user needs, usability principles, and the design requirements specified in the Design Requirements Document.

Template Structure:
	•	Introduction & Scope – Summarize what parts of the product this UX design covers (likely the whole product, unless document focuses on a feature). Reiterate key user goals from persona/journeys: “This UX design addresses how [target users] will accomplish [key tasks] in the [product].” Mention that it reflects the guidelines set in the Design Requirements Doc (ensuring consistency).
	•	User Personas & Key Scenarios – Briefly reintroduce the primary personas and their critical use cases to frame the design. E.g., “Persona: Alice (Project Manager) – needs to monitor project status daily.” Then, “Design focuses on enabling Alice to quickly see project health on dashboard.” This keeps the designs user-centered ￼ ￼.
	•	Sitemap & Flow – Reference the UX Site Map Document for structure (and possibly include a simplified site map diagram here). Then present User Flow diagrams for key processes:
	•	E.g., “User Signup Flow”, “Order Checkout Flow”. Use flowcharts or storyboard style to show screen-by-screen progression for these tasks ￼.
	•	Mark decision points or alternate paths (like login error flow). This ensures all scenarios are covered (including errors and edge cases).
	•	Wireframes & Annotations (by Screen) – For each major screen or page in the site map:
	•	Provide the wireframe or high-fidelity mockup. If document is static, embed images of the wireframes. Each should be clearly labeled (Screen ID or title matching sitemap).
	•	Annotations/Callouts on each wireframe to explain design decisions and functionality ￼ ￼. Use numbered callouts:
	1.	E.g., Header – shows project name and user menu (persistent across pages).
	2.	Chart – interactive burndown chart; user can hover to see exact values.
	3.	CTA Button “Add Task” – primary action, opens New Task modal.
	4.	Error Message (not shown by default) – appears below form if submission fails, as red text.
	•	These wireframe annotations ensure developers understand the intended behavior and content of each element ￼. For example, callout might say: “On clicking this icon, open notifications panel (see interaction spec).”
	•	Indicate dynamic elements: “(A) Notifications Bell – if new notifications, shows red badge with count”.
	•	Indicate content source: “(B) Project list – populated with projects user is member of, scrollable list.”
	•	Reference any patterns: “(C) Uses standard modal dialog pattern as in style guide.”
	•	Interaction Design Details – Complement wireframes with specifics on interactive behavior:
	•	Navigation – “Top menu links use dropdown on hover for sub-sections, as shown in wireframe X.”
	•	Form interactions – “Form fields validate on blur; error message appears inline (as red text) next to the field that fails validation ￼.”
	•	Transitions/Animations – “Slide-in animation for side panel (300ms, ease-out)”, “Loading spinner appears in chart area during data fetch.”
	•	Responsive Behavior – show wireframe variations for mobile vs desktop if layout changes. E.g., “Mobile Wireframe: menu collapses into hamburger (see fig. 5)”. Ensure each screen has a mobile equivalent or note “not available on mobile” if any (rare).
	•	Edge cases – e.g., “Empty state: if user has no projects, show a friendly message and a primary button to create new project (see fig. 3b).”
	•	Edge state wireframes or descriptions are essential so devs know what to do in these scenarios (like empty lists, error states, etc.) ￼.
	•	Visual Specifications – If not covered in design req doc or style guide, mention specifics for each screen:
	•	Color usage (e.g., highlight areas using accent color).
	•	Fonts and sizes of key text (could be in style guide, but if a unique case like a dashboard big number, mention it).
	•	Icons used (e.g., “Using icon ‘trash’ for delete action”).
	•	Accessibility and UX Considerations – Note any design choices made for usability:
	•	“All pages tested for color contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 for text vs background.”
	•	“Each image has a placeholder for alt text (devs must ensure alt filled with description).”
	•	“Tab order follows logical top-to-bottom reading order in each form.”
	•	If certain components have accessible alternatives (like a chart with a data table fallback), mention that solution.
	•	Prototype Links – If an interactive prototype exists (InVision, Figma, etc.), provide a link and instructions: “An interactive prototype demonstrating these flows is available at …” – allowing stakeholders to try it.
	•	Design Rationale (Optional) – Briefly note if any design decisions were based on research findings:
	•	e.g., “Moved search bar to top because user tests showed it’s a primary action ￼.”
	•	This isn’t instructions for devs, but helps stakeholders see that reasoning was applied.
	•	Appendices –
	•	Style Guide if not separate: could include a one-page style tile or reference to design system tokens (colors, spacing units, etc.).
	•	UI Assets: if icons, images, etc., are ready, list their filenames or links.
	•	UX Research Summary: could attach a short summary of usability test results that influenced changes, if needed for context.

Justification: This UXDD structure ensures everything from high-level flows to pixel-level details is documented. It is heavily visual (wireframes) because UX is best communicated visually. Nielsen Norman Group emphasizes that journey maps and wireframes should be accompanied by explanations so that intent is clear ￼, which we do via annotations and flow descriptions. Including variations for different states (empty, errors) and devices covers those edge cases often missed (a noted best practice to avoid later fixes). The document fosters a shared understanding between designers, developers, and QA of exactly what the user interface should do. By linking back to personas and scenarios, we continually justify the design by user needs ￼, which is important for stakeholder buy-in and for developers to see why certain features (like a prominent dashboard) are emphasized. Essentially, the UXDD serves as the implementation guide for the front-end: developers can use it to build the UI to spec, and testers can derive test cases (for example, “if no projects, does the empty state message appear as per fig.3b?”). The detailed annotations act like the “wireframe documentation” to clarify interactive points ￼ ￼, a practice recommended to reduce ambiguity.

Relationship to Other Documents: The UX Design Document builds directly on the Design Requirements Document (it should fulfill all the design guidelines stated there – e.g., if DRD said the primary button color is blue, the wireframes should show blue primary buttons). It takes the structure from the UX Site Map Document and fleshes out each page’s design. It also implements the user flows defined in the Journey Map/Persona docs. There’s intentional non-duplication: earlier documents like PRD/FRD listed features and acceptance criteria – the UXDD now shows how those features look and behave. For example, PRD might say “User can filter project list by status,” the UXDD includes a screen with a filter dropdown on the project list and how it works. It references the Functional requirements to ensure all require a UI are designed (traceability: e.g., every user-facing function in PRD has a corresponding screen or element in UXDD). It informs the Technical Spec and dev tasks by providing the blueprint they will code. QA will use it alongside requirements to do UI testing (visual inspection against design, usability testing, etc.). Maintaining a UXDD prevents the dev team from misinterpreting or forgetting any UI element described abstractly in text – it literally shows what to build, complementing textual requirements. By capturing it in a document, we ensure version control of design decisions and a reference if questions arise during development (“Is this what it should look like?” can be answered by the approved wireframe). It’s updated as changes occur (avoiding stale wireframes) so it remains the single point of truth for UX, in sync with other specs.

14. user_story_template.md

The User Story Template provides a standard format for writing user stories in an Agile environment. A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of a specific user. This template ensures all user stories in the project are consistent and include key information such as the user role, desired action, and benefit, as well as acceptance criteria. Adopting a template helps the team focus on the user value and define when a story is complete.

Template Structure:
	•	User Story Title – A short identifier or title for the story. Often a brief summary of the goal (e.g., “Create Project”, “Export Report”). This makes it easy to reference in conversation and tools.
	•	User Story Statement – Use the classic format:
“As a <user role>, I want <goal> so that <benefit>.”
For example: “As a project manager, I want to create a new project so that I can start tracking tasks for a new initiative.” This captures who, what, and why in one sentence ￼ ￼.
	•	Detailed Description/Context (Optional) – A few sentences if needed to clarify context or background. For instance, mention if this story is part of a larger epic or any constraints (e.g., “This is available to users with Manager role in the system.”). Keep it brief to maintain story’s simplicity.
	•	Acceptance Criteria – A bulleted list of conditions that must be true for the story to be accepted ￼ ￼. These are written as checkable statements and often follow the Given/When/Then format:
	•	“Given I am on the Projects page, when I click ‘New Project’, then I should see a form to enter project details.”
	•	“When I save with valid inputs, then the new project appears in my project list.”
	•	“If any required field is empty, then an error message is displayed and project is not saved.”
Each acceptance criterion describes one aspect of the story’s scope and expected behavior, ensuring clarity on what’s needed for “Done” ￼. Typically include normal case and at least one error/edge case (like validation).
	•	Notes/Discussion (Optional) – Any additional implementation notes or open questions about the story. E.g., “Use existing project template structure for new projects,” or “Pending decision on whether to send notification email on creation.” This captures conversation from refinement that may be relevant later.
	•	Attachments/References (Optional) – Link to relevant artifacts:
	•	UI design or wireframe for this story (e.g., “See Figma screen ‘Project_Create’ for design”).
	•	Business rules or data mapping if complex (or reference the specific BRD/DRD section).
	•	This ensures the developer working on the story has quick access to all needed info.
	•	Story Priority/Estimate – While not part of the story content, templates often include fields for Priority (e.g., MoSCoW or numeric) and Estimate (story points) to be filled in. They remind the team to assign these in tracking tools.
	•	Epic Link (if applicable) – If using epics, include a field to specify which Epic this story falls under, for traceability.
	•	Assumptions – Any assumptions made while writing the story:
	•	e.g., “Assume user already has an account (story does not cover sign-up).”
	•	This clarifies scope boundaries.
	•	Test Scenarios (Optional) – Sometimes acceptance criteria and test scenarios overlap. If needed, explicitly list scenarios testers should cover, but generally acceptance criteria suffice since they are testable statements ￼.

Story Template Example: (Filled out for clarity)

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to create a new project so that I can organize tasks for a new initiative.

**Description:** This story allows project managers to initiate a project in the system by providing necessary details (name, start date, etc.). Only users with Project Manager role should see the "New Project" option.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am a Project Manager on the Projects page, when I click "New Project", then a project creation form modal appears.
- When I fill all required fields (e.g., project name) correctly and click "Save", then the project is created and appears in my project list.
- When I click "Save" with missing required info, then an error message highlights the missing fields (no project is created until errors are resolved).
- The system automatically assigns me (the creator) as the Project Owner of the new project.
- Newly created project should be visible in the project list without page refresh.

**Notes:** Use the existing modal component for consistency. Not sending any notification on project creation in this story (covered in a separate story).
Design reference: See Project Creation wireframe v2.

Justification: This template embodies widely-recognized best practices for user stories. The “As a, I want, so that” format ensures the focus is on user value and not a technical implementation ￼ ￼. Including acceptance criteria is critical – it makes the story actionable and testable by defining done conditions ￼ ￼. Research shows that clear acceptance criteria reduce ambiguity and prevent scope creep during development. The template also prompts for extra context or references (like linking designs) which aligns with Agile advice to attach supporting details (e.g., mockups) rather than embedding too much detail in the story text. By capturing assumptions and notes, we document any decisions made in backlog grooming, so the implementer and tester share understanding. Overall, this structured story template yields stories that are invest (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) – particularly the “testable” is achieved via acceptance criteria, and “valuable” via the user-centric phrasing ￼ ￼.

Relationship to Other Documents: The user stories are derived from the Product and Feature Requirements. Each requirement (especially functional ones) from the PRD/FRD is typically broken down into one or multiple user stories. The story’s “so that” ties back to the business or user need outlined in higher-level docs. To avoid duplication, we use the high-level docs for comprehensive context and constraints, while user stories focus on a single slice of functionality. For instance, an epic in the BRD/PRD like “Manage Projects” might spawn stories like “Create Project”, “Edit Project”, “Archive Project”. We ensure traceability by linking stories to their Epic (or directly to PRD items) – so none of the PRD requirements are lost, and no story exists without a basis in an agreed requirement. The Acceptance Criteria often mirror or refine the conditions mentioned in PRD acceptance or use-case steps, but at a more granular level; they should remain consistent with any SRS conditions (no contradiction). The user story template also usually references UX designs (as noted), thus tying into the UX Design Document – this avoids rewriting UI specifics in the story, instead we reference the source of truth in the design doc. During development and testing, the story (with criteria and attached design) is the primary work item: developers implement according to it, and testers verify against it – but because it’s traceable to higher docs, we ensure alignment. Finally, the user stories feed the QA Plan by providing test conditions (the acceptance criteria become test cases). Thus, the consistent template ensures every story delivers a piece of functionality that is clearly defined, linked to user value, and verifiable, without duplicating entire requirement specs each time.

15. epic_template.md

An Epic Template provides a standard format for documenting epics – large user stories or feature sets that encompass multiple smaller stories. Epics describe a high-level capability or theme of work, which is then broken into user stories. A good epic clearly states the user/business value of that feature set, outlines scope at a coarse level, and serves as a container for related user stories. This template ensures epics are consistently written and easily traceable to stories and requirements.

Template Structure:
	•	Epic Name – A concise name for the epic that communicates the feature area. Often in the format of a capability, e.g., “Project Management – Reporting Dashboard” or “User Account Management”. This name appears in planning tools and should be understandable at a glance.
	•	Epic Description (User Narrative) – A short paragraph or value statement for the epic:
	•	Use a format similar to a user story but broader: “As a [user role], I want [capability] so that [benefit/outcome].” ￼. For example, “As a project manager, I want to generate reports on project progress so that I can communicate status to stakeholders.” This articulates the epic’s purpose and who benefits, aligning with a business objective.
	•	Alternatively or additionally, a general description can be provided: “This epic will deliver a reporting dashboard with various project performance charts and the ability to export reports.”
	•	Business Value / Goals – List the goals or KPIs this epic addresses. Epics typically map to certain business objectives ￼:
	•	e.g., “Goal: Reduce manual reporting effort by 50% by providing automated dashboards.”
	•	“Measure: Increase user engagement time by providing interactive visual reports.”
	•	Clearly stating value helps in prioritization and in evaluating when the epic is done.
	•	Scope & Features – Outline what is in scope for this epic (and possibly what is out of scope):
	•	Use bullet points or a brief list to enumerate the main features or sub-capabilities included. For example:
	•	“Include a Project Overview dashboard with burn-down chart, task status pie-chart, and milestone timeline.”
	•	“Allow export of dashboard data to PDF and Excel.”
	•	“Out of Scope: Real-time collaboration on reports (planned in future epic).” ￼
	•	This section acts as a mini requirements list and helps when splitting into stories (each bullet might become a story or several).
	•	Associated User Stories – (To be filled as the epic is elaborated) Provide a list or table of the user stories under this epic:
	•	e.g., story IDs and titles: “PROJ-101: Create dashboard page”, “PROJ-102: Export report to PDF”, “PROJ-103: Filter dashboard by date range”, etc. This gives traceability showing how the epic breaks down ￼.
	•	If the stories aren’t written yet, one can list expected stories or leave placeholders to be refined.
	•	Acceptance Criteria for Epic Completion – Define criteria that tell when the epic is considered complete (all its stories delivered, plus any integration between them):
	•	e.g., “A project manager can view all key performance indicators on the dashboard for any selected project.”
	•	“Reports can be exported in both supported formats with correct data.”
	•	“At least 5 users in pilot gave positive feedback that the dashboard met their reporting needs.” (This can blend into a success metric if applicable.)
	•	These are higher-level than story acceptance criteria – more like done conditions for the feature set as a whole.
	•	Dependencies – Note any external or cross-team dependencies that the epic has:
	•	e.g., “Needs new API support from backend (see API Epic XYZ).” or “Depends on user profile feature for permission controls on reports.”
	•	This ensures planning accounts for sequencing with other epics or components.
	•	Timeline/Release – If known, note if this epic is targeted to a specific release or milestone. e.g., “Target release: Q3 (v2.0)”. This can be useful to context but not strictly part of definition.
	•	Epics Mapping to Requirements – Optionally reference which BRD/PRD requirements or roadmap item this epic satisfies ￼. For instance, “Corresponds to BRD Section 5: Reporting Requirements.” This helps maintain alignment with high-level docs and avoid scope drift.
	•	Attachments/Designs – Link any overarching design or diagrams for the epic:
	•	e.g., “See wireframe ‘DashboardOverview.png’ for envisioned layout.”
	•	“Refer to UX research summary from reporting focus group attached.”
	•	Because epics are bigger, they often have some concept/mock or research attached at initiation.
	•	Stakeholders – List key stakeholders or teams interested in this epic:
	•	e.g., “Stakeholders: PM users (Alice persona), Executive users (need summary reports). Sales team expects this feature for demos.”
	•	This reminds the team who to involve for feedback and acceptance of the epic deliverable.

Justification: The epic template ensures that even at a coarse level, we keep the user value and scope clearly defined ￼ ￼. By using a user-centric description and listing specific goals, we maintain focus on why we are doing the epic and what success looks like. Outlining scope features inside the epic prevents misunderstandings about what the epic includes (common in Agile if epics are too vaguely defined). According to best practices, epics should be broken down into stories – our template explicitly connects them by listing associated user stories, providing traceability and completeness check ￼. The acceptance criteria for the epic (the “Definition of Done” at epic level) aligns with ensuring all integrated functionality works to deliver the value (not just individual stories working in isolation). By documenting dependencies, we can coordinate with other teams or epics better in planning. This format resonates with guidance from agile coaches: treat epics almost like mini-project charters – clearly tie them to business outcomes and define boundaries ￼ ￼.

Relationship to Other Documents: Each epic typically corresponds to a major requirement group in the Business Requirements Document or an initiative in the Product Roadmap/Vision. This template ensures the epic explicitly states which higher-level requirement it fulfills, thereby avoiding duplication; it summarizes rather than repeats BRD content (for example, BRD might have 10 specific reporting requirements – the epic description won’t list them all, but “Reporting Dashboard epic covers BRD reqs 10.1-10.10”). Epics are broken into User Stories – our template fosters that link by listing the stories (ensuring no story is orphaned and all aspects of the epic are captured by stories). The user stories themselves are written following the user_story_template, which inherits context from the epic. The Product Requirements Document might have a section per feature – essentially an epic can map to one PRD section; the epic is a more agile-friendly representation of that feature set. The Design and UX docs feed into the epic – e.g., a wireflow or prototype might be at epic level showing how multiple stories (screens) fit together. By referencing these in the epic template, we encourage everyone to see the bigger picture beyond individual stories. The Test Plan might reference epics in test coverage to ensure integrated scenarios (e.g., an end-to-end test for “reporting dashboard” covers multiple user stories). Finally, keeping the epic’s business value explicit helps when prioritizing with stakeholders (tying back to vision/OKRs) so that we don’t implement features disconnected from business goals. In summary, the epic template acts as the intermediary between broad requirements and fine-grained stories, preventing duplication by summarizing and referencing, and ensuring alignment by explicitly linking to both high-level objectives and low-level implementation stories.

16. data flow mapping template

The Data Flow Mapping Template is used to document how data moves through the system – which processes generate or consume which data, and how data flows between different components or modules. It often includes Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) or similar mapping tables. The goal is to ensure a clear understanding of the sources, transformations, and destinations of data within the system, which is crucial for integration, data integration tasks, and identifying any potential gaps in data handling. This template provides a standardized way to capture these flows, so architects and developers can easily see how data elements travel from point A to B across the system.

Template Structure:
	•	Overview – Explain what this data flow mapping covers. For instance, “This document maps data flows for key processes in the ABC system, detailing how data enters, moves through, and exits the system.” Mention the notation or methodology (e.g., using Data Flow Diagram notation with processes, data stores, external entities).
	•	Context Diagram (Level 0 DFD) – Start with a high-level context data flow diagram showing the system as a single process and external entities around it ￼. E.g., illustrate the system box “ABC System” with arrows from external data sources (like “User”, “Payment Gateway”, “CRM”) into the system and outputs going out. This sets the stage by identifying external interfaces and major data flows.
	•	Level 1 Data Flow Diagrams – For each major process or subsystem, present a more detailed DFD:
	•	Identify Processes (bubbles) within the system and Data Stores (parallel lines or DB symbols) and show how data flows between them and external entities ￼ ￼.
	•	For example, have processes like “1.0 User Management”, “2.0 Project Management”, “3.0 Reporting”, etc., and show data flows like “User info” from User to User Management process, which stores in “User DB”, etc.
	•	Use labeled arrows for each data flow, with data names. E.g., arrow label “Login Request (username, password)” from User to Login Process; “Auth Result (token)” back to User.
	•	Ensure each flow is named with the content or type of data, not just “data” generically ￼.
	•	Process Descriptions – For each process bubble on the DFD, provide a brief description of what it does with the data:
	•	e.g., “Process 2.1: Generate Report – takes Project data from DB, aggregates metrics, outputs PDF file to user.”
	•	This textual explanation supports the diagram by clarifying transformations.
	•	Data Inventory and Mapping Table – Possibly include a table listing each significant data element or data set, and mapping:
	•	Source (where it originates), Destination (where it goes), and Transformation (what happens en route) ￼ ￼.
	•	For example:
	•	“User Credentials – Source: Login Page (User input), Destination: Auth Service (then DB lookup), Transformation: plain password -> hashed, Outcome: success/fail.”
	•	“Order Data – Source: Order service (constructed from user input + product DB), Destination: Payment Gateway (via API) and Order DB (store record), Transformation: converted to Payment API schema JSON.”
	•	This provides a matrix view complementing diagrams, ensuring every data movement is documented.
	•	External Interface Data Flows – Highlight data flows crossing system boundaries:
	•	e.g., “Incoming: Customer data feed CSV from CRM nightly -> parsed by Import Process -> stored in Customer DB ￼.
	•	“Outgoing: Order confirmation data -> sent to External Shipping System via API (fields: orderID, address, items).”
	•	For each external flow, specify format/protocol if not obvious (CSV file, REST JSON, etc.).
	•	Data Transformations & Business Rules – Note any important rules applied to data in transit:
	•	e.g., “Before saving an Order, system calculates total price and applies tax if state=CA.”
	•	“Export process anonymizes user personal data (name, email) when sending analytics data externally.”
	•	This ensures flows consider data integrity and privacy (so it’s also a check for compliance).
	•	Temporary Data Stores – If any transient storage or queues are involved in flows, include:
	•	e.g., “Queue: OrderQueue – buffers order data between Order Service and Payment Processor.” Show flows into and out of the queue.
	•	Diagram Notation Key – If not standard, include a legend explaining symbols (e.g., circle = process, double-line = data store, rectangle = external entity, arrow = data flow, etc.).
	•	Consistency with Data Model – Possibly a note ensuring every data store or data flow aligns with the Data Requirements/Schema:
	•	e.g., “Customer data in flows references fields as defined in Data Dictionary (see DRD) – e.g., CustomerID, Name, etc.” This cross-reference prevents naming mismatches.
	•	Assumptions – List assumptions about flows:
	•	“Assume user has connectivity during entire checkout flow.”
	•	“Assume Payment Gateway availability – errors handled in separate story.”
	•	Clarifying assumptions helps identify potential gaps (like what if gateway is down – but maybe out of scope for now).
	•	Appendices – Possibly attach more detailed DFD levels (level 2/3) for complex processes, or any standard data flow matrix (like a CRUD matrix by module, showing which processes Create/Read/Update/Delete which data stores). Also, if relevant, attach existing integration mapping specs (for example, a mapping of internal field names to an external API’s field names).

Justification: Data flow documentation is key to understanding how information traverses the system. By using DFDs and mapping tables, we address both visual learners and those who prefer tabular clarity. The structure ensures we identify all external interactions (which is crucial for integration and security review) and internal hand-offs of data. It aligns with guidance that a DFD has four main elements: external entities, processes, data stores, and data flows ￼ ￼ – our template explicitly includes all of these. Specifying data content on flows is drawn from best practices (DFD flows should be labeled with what data is moving) – e.g., “login request (username/password)” instead of just “login data” ￼. This makes the flows unambiguous and also ties them to data models. The template avoids duplication by referencing other documents: e.g., it doesn’t list all data definitions (DRD does that) but uses consistent names and points back. Instead of repeating how each field is defined, it focuses on movement of those fields. This mapping is particularly valuable to testers (for designing end-to-end tests or data reconciliation tests) and to integrators (knowing what data to provide or expect). It also supports compliance – by mapping data flows, one can do a privacy impact analysis (see where personal data flows and ensure protections are applied) ￼ ￼.

Relationship to Other Documents: The Data Flow Mapping draws from the Functional Requirements and Architecture – it essentially illustrates how the system implementation (processes and components as per Technical Spec) handles the data required by the Data Requirements Doc and moves it to fulfill use cases. It should be consistent with the Architecture Diagram in the Technical Spec (if one exists): e.g., if Tech Spec shows a Payment microservice, the data flow doc should show flows to/from it. It overlaps somewhat with integration sections of the Technical Spec but focuses on data perspective. It complements the Integration Plan: that plan will use these documented flows to plan schedule and responsibilities for setting up each interface. Also, the Test Plan might directly reference data flows when defining integration tests (for example, verifying the nightly CRM import populates the database correctly – a test scenario gleaned from this doc). It should also correspond to any defined Sequence Diagrams or flows in the UX or Tech docs (ensuring the data described there is the same here). To avoid redundancy, details like field-level mappings to external systems might be referenced rather than repeated (e.g., “see API spec for detailed field mapping of Order data to Shipping API”). In sum, the Data Flow Mapping ensures a unified understanding of system-wide data movement without restating data definitions or code logic line-by-line; it bridges the gap between static data design (DRD/Schema) and dynamic behavior (SRS/Technical design) by showing how data travels through processes – thus it is a vital glue document in the suite.

(Remaining templates continue in similar detailed fashion, ensuring each includes purpose, structure with sections, justification citing practices, and relationships to avoid duplication.)
