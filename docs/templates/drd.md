Great. I will create a comprehensive and generic Data Requirements Document (DRD) template formatted in Markdown. It will include clearly labeled sections with concise descriptions or guiding questions, and also sample content for each section to guide internal project, engineering, and data teams working on internal tool development.

I’ll let you know as soon as the template is ready for your review.


# Data Requirements Document (DRD) Template

## Title Page

*Guidance: Provide basic document information including the project or tool name, version, date of last update, author(s), and relevant department or team.*

**Project/Tool Name:** DataHub Integration Platform
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 23, 2025
**Author:** Jane Doe (Data Engineer)
**Department:** Data Engineering Team

## Document Purpose

*Guidance: What is the purpose of this document? What data needs will it address for the internal tool or workflow?*

**Example:** The purpose of this document is to outline all data requirements for the *DataHub Integration Platform*. It explains what data the platform needs to ingest and produce, and how these data support the platform’s functionality in the internal workflow. This ensures that project stakeholders and the development team have a clear, shared understanding of the data needs and how they align with the project’s goals.

## Stakeholders & Data Owners

*Guidance: Who are the key stakeholders and data owners for this project? Identify who is responsible for data stewardship and quality.*

**Example:**

* **Project Sponsor:** John Doe (Head of Analytics) – Champion for the project, ensuring it aligns with business goals.
* **Product Owner/Data Steward:** Jane Smith (Data Governance Lead) – Owns the data requirements and ensures data quality and compliance. Each major data domain has a designated owner responsible for its accuracy and maintenance.
* **Engineering Lead:** Alice Johnson (Lead Data Engineer) – Oversees implementation of data pipelines, ensuring technical feasibility of requirements.
* **Data Consumer Representative:** Bob Lee (Business Analyst) – End-user of the data (e.g., marketing analyst or finance manager) who provides input on data needs and validates that outputs meet expectations.
* **IT Security Officer:** Maria Gomez – Consulted for data security and privacy requirements, ensuring the solution adheres to corporate policies.

## Data Overview

*Guidance: Describe the types of data involved in this project—e.g., input data, output data, reference data, master data. Where does each type of data come from, and how will it be used?*

**Example:** This project will handle multiple data types:

* *Input Data:* Transaction records and customer profiles imported from operational systems (e.g., sales orders, user account details). These are the raw data points the platform will ingest daily.
* *Reference Data:* Lookup tables such as product catalogs, currency exchange rates, and region codes, which remain relatively static and are used to enrich or validate input data.
* *Output Data:* Aggregated analytics and reports (e.g., monthly sales summaries, customer segmentation results) that the platform will generate for business users. This output data will be consumed by analytics dashboards and downstream reporting tools.
* *Master Data:* Core entities like **Customer**, **Product**, and **Account** mastered in enterprise systems. The platform will use these as the authoritative source to ensure consistency across all calculations.

## Data Sources

*Guidance: What internal/external systems, databases, or files will provide or consume data? List all sources and sinks (destinations) for the data in this project.*

**Example:**

* **Internal CRM Database (Customer Data):** Source of customer profiles and account information (e.g., from a CRM like Salesforce).
* **Sales Transactions System:** Internal sales database providing order and transaction records.
* **External Marketing API:** Third-party API supplying campaign performance metrics (e.g., clicks, impressions) to be integrated.
* **Data Warehouse:** Enterprise data warehouse where consolidated data will be stored and from which reporting tools will query output data.
* **Analytics Dashboard:** The internal BI tool (e.g., Tableau or Power BI) that consumes the curated data for visualization and analysis.

## Data Elements & Definitions

*Guidance: Define all key data fields, entities, attributes, and formats. Include data types, allowable values, and business rules for each important data element.*

**Example:** Key data elements for the **Customer** and **Order** entities include:

* **Customer\_ID** – *Unique identifier for a customer.* (Integer, unique key. *Example:* 100123)
* **Customer\_Type** – *Categorization of customer.* (String; allowable values: `"Individual"`, `"Business"`. *Business rule:* Individual customers cannot have more than one active account.)
* **Order\_ID** – *Unique order number linking to a transaction.* (String/UUID, unique per order. *Example:* `ORD-2025-0001`)
* **Order\_Date** – *Date and time when the order was placed.* (Datetime, ISO 8601 format. *Example:* `2025-06-01T14:30:00Z`)
* **Order\_Total** – *Total monetary value of the order.* (Decimal, in USD; must be non-negative. *Example:* 259.99)

## Data Flow & Mapping

*Guidance: Describe or diagram how data moves through the system or workflow. How is data transformed, validated, or joined? Include mapping details between source and target data (e.g., how fields from source systems map to the internal data model), and mention any key transformation or validation logic.*

**Example:** Data flows through the platform in defined stages:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Source data (e.g., CRM customer records, sales transactions) is extracted daily from the source systems.
2. **Transformation & Mapping:** The ingested data is validated (ensuring required fields are present and values are in expected formats) and transformed to fit the unified schema. For example, source fields like `cust_name` and `cust_id` are mapped to the **Customer** entity fields `Customer_Name` and `Customer_ID` in the platform’s database.
3. **Data Integration:** Transformed data is joined with reference data (e.g., adding region names from a reference table using region codes) to enrich the dataset.
4. **Loading to Warehouse:** The consolidated, cleaned data is loaded into the data warehouse tables.
5. **Consumption:** The data warehouse is then queried by the Analytics Dashboard and other tools. End-users see unified reports with all transformations applied, ensuring consistent and correct data is presented.

## Data Quality Requirements

*Guidance: What are the expectations for data quality (accuracy, completeness, timeliness, consistency, and reliability)? Define measurable criteria or targets for each dimension. How will data quality be monitored and maintained over time?*

**Example:** The project sets the following data quality criteria:

* **Accuracy:** Data must reflect the source of truth with at least 99% accuracy for critical fields (e.g., customer IDs, order totals). Regular cross-checks against source systems will be performed.
* **Completeness:** 100% of required fields (marked as mandatory) must be populated in each record. Any missing or null values in mandatory fields trigger an error for correction before data is accepted.
* **Timeliness:** Data from the previous business day must be available in the system by 6:00 AM the next day for reporting. Late data arrivals trigger an alert so stakeholders are informed.
* **Consistency:** Data definitions and codes are consistent across all sources (for instance, if customer status code `"ACTIVE"` is used, all systems should use that exact code). Master data management processes ensure that each real-world entity (customer, product, etc.) has one consistent representation across the system.
* **Reliability:** The data pipeline operates reliably, with successful daily loads at least 95% of the time. Any pipeline failure or data anomaly is logged and addressed promptly to prevent recurrence.

## Security, Privacy, & Compliance

*Guidance: What are the security, privacy, and compliance requirements for the data? Consider access controls, encryption (in transit and at rest), data masking/anonymization, audit logging, data retention policies, and adherence to regulations (e.g., GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, HIPAA) as applicable.*

**Example:**

* **Access Control:** Implement role-based access controls so that only authorized personnel (e.g., specific data engineers, analysts) can view or modify sensitive data. All access to production data is logged for audit purposes.
* **Encryption:** All data must be encrypted both in transit (using protocols like HTTPS/SSL for any data transfer) and at rest (using database or disk encryption) to prevent unauthorized access.
* **PII Handling & Privacy:** Sensitive personal data (e.g., names, contact information, identification numbers) is masked or anonymized in non-production environments. In compliance with privacy regulations (like GDPR in the EU, LGPD in Brazil, CCPA in California), define how personally identifiable information is handled, stored, and deleted to meet legal requirements.
* **Compliance & Audit:** The system must meet any industry-specific regulations or internal policies. For example, if handling healthcare data, it must comply with HIPAA rules. Define data retention limits (e.g., user data retained for 5 years unless otherwise required) and ensure an audit trail is maintained. Regular audits will be conducted to verify compliance, and any access to or export of sensitive data will require managerial approval.

## Data Volume & Performance

*Guidance: Estimate the data volumes and growth rates, and specify performance requirements. How much data (records, GB) will the system handle initially and in the future? What are the throughput and response time requirements for data processing and queries?*

**Example:** Initially, the system will ingest approximately **500,000 records per day** (around **50 GB/day** of data). With an expected growth rate of \~10% per month, the design must accommodate scaling to around **1 million records per day** within a year. The database is anticipated to grow to **5–10 TB** of data in the first year. To ensure performance:

* Efficient storage and indexing strategies (such as partitioning data by date or category) will be used to keep query response times under 3 seconds for standard reports.
* The data pipeline (ETL processes) should process a full day’s data within a 2-hour batch window each night.
* As data volume grows, the infrastructure will be monitored and scaled (e.g., adding compute resources or optimizing queries) to meet performance SLAs. This includes regular performance testing to identify bottlenecks before they impact users.

## Integration & Interfaces

*Guidance: Describe any integrations with other systems and the interfaces used. List APIs, data feeds, ETL/ELT processes, or file transfer mechanisms involved in exchanging data. Include details like frequency (real-time vs batch), data formats, and protocols.*

**Example:**

* **Inbound API Integration:** The platform provides a REST API endpoint for internal applications to send data (e.g., a mobile app pushing user activity events in real time as JSON payloads). API documentation defines required fields and authentication (e.g., using API keys or OAuth).
* **Outbound Data Feed/API:** The platform exposes an API for approved consumers to query processed data (for instance, a finance system pulling daily summary metrics). For systems without API capability, a daily CSV file export is provided via secure FTP as an alternative interface.
* **Batch ETL Jobs:** Nightly ETL processes run at 1:00 AM to pull data from the Sales Transactions system and other sources into the DataHub’s staging area. After transformation, these jobs load the data into the warehouse. Logs and email alerts are generated for any ETL failures.
* **BI Tool Connection:** The data warehouse is connected to a business intelligence tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) via a JDBC/ODBC or native connector. Analysts and data scientists can access the data warehouse directly for reporting and analysis under controlled read-only access.

## Data Lifecycle Management

*Guidance: How will data be managed throughout its life? Describe how data is created or collected, how it’s updated, when/if it gets archived, and when it is deleted. Include data retention periods, archival mechanisms, and backup/recovery plans.*

**Example:** The lifecycle of data in this system is managed as follows:

1. **Creation/Collection:** New data is created or collected whenever events occur in source systems (e.g., a new order is placed in the sales system, or a new customer signs up). These records are ingested into the platform either in real-time via APIs or in daily batch loads.
2. **Update:** When source data changes (for example, a customer updates their profile information), those updates flow into the platform on the next data sync. The system keeps track of changes (audit logs or history tables) for critical fields to maintain an audit trail.
3. **Archival:** As data ages, old records (e.g., transactions older than 5 years) are moved to an archive storage tier. Archived data is removed from the active database to improve performance, but it’s still kept in a secure archive (such as a cloud storage bucket or separate archive database) in case it’s needed for historical analysis or compliance.
4. **Deletion:** Data that has reached the end of its retention period (e.g., 7 years for transaction data, or sooner if dictated by a *Right to Erasure* request under privacy laws) is permanently deleted from all systems. Deletion processes are designed to remove data from primary storage and backups, with careful logging of what was removed and by whom.
5. **Backup & Recovery:** Regular backups are performed to prevent data loss. Full backups might be taken weekly with incremental backups daily. Backup files are encrypted and stored offsite. In the event of data corruption or system failure, there is a disaster recovery plan to restore data from the latest backups (with an objective of, say, <24 hours to fully restore service).

## Assumptions & Constraints

*Guidance: Document any assumptions made during the requirements definition and any constraints that must be considered. Assumptions are conditions you expect to be true (but may not be guaranteed). Constraints are limitations or restrictions (technical, legal, or organizational) that impact the data solution.*

**Example:**

* *Assumption:* Source systems (CRM, Sales DB, etc.) will continue to capture all necessary data and remain available for the daily data integration.
* *Assumption:* The data definitions and business rules will remain stable during the project (major changes in requirements would trigger a revision of this document).
* *Constraint:* The solution must use approved technologies and infrastructure already in place (for example, the company’s standard cloud data platform) due to IT governance policies.
* *Constraint:* Data residency requirements mandate that all customer personal data remains within the EU region. This limits where cloud databases can be hosted and necessitates compliance checks.
* *Constraint:* The external marketing API has a rate limit of 10,000 records per hour, which restricts how quickly we can ingest campaign data and requires scheduling and possible data buffering to stay within limits.

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

*Guidance: List the key risks related to data in the project and how you plan to mitigate them. Consider risks to data quality, integration, security, compliance, etc. For each risk, provide a brief description and at least one mitigation or contingency strategy.*

**Example:**

* **Risk: Data quality issues (e.g., missing or incorrect values) could lead to faulty analysis or reports.** *Mitigation:* Implement rigorous data validation at ingestion and use automated quality checks. Any records failing validation will be quarantined for review. A data steward will routinely monitor data quality dashboards and address issues by correcting source data or refining transformation rules.
* **Risk: An integration point (source system or API) becomes unavailable, causing delays in data updates.** *Mitigation:* Build retry and failover mechanisms into data pipelines (e.g., if the primary API fails, the system will retry after a delay and/or switch to a backup source if available). Also, send immediate failure alerts to the engineering team so they can take manual action if needed.
* **Risk: Security breach or unauthorized access to sensitive data.** *Mitigation:* Apply strict security controls (as outlined in the Security section) including encryption, access control, and continuous monitoring. Conduct regular security audits and have an incident response plan in place. In case of a breach, the response plan will be executed to contain and remediate the issue, and affected parties will be notified according to compliance requirements.
* **Risk: Evolving compliance regulations (new laws or policies) might render our data practices non-compliant.** *Mitigation:* The data governance team will stay informed about regulatory changes. We design the system with flexibility (e.g., configurable data retention settings) so that policy changes can be implemented with minimal rework. Regular reviews of compliance posture will be scheduled, and legal counsel will be consulted to update practices as needed.

## Approval & Sign-off

*Guidance: Identify who must review and approve this document. List the relevant roles (and individuals, if known) that need to sign off. Include a section for recording approvals and dates.*

**Example:** The following stakeholders must review and approve this Data Requirements Document:

* **Project Manager:** John Doe – *Reviewed and Approved on 2025-06-23*
