Great! I’ll create a comprehensive Epic Template tailored for internal development workflows, optimized for teams using Linear but without strict adherence to a methodology. This will include all the necessary sections with clear guiding questions and descriptions.

I’ll let you know as soon as it’s ready for your review.
