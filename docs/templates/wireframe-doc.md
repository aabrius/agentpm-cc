Perfeito. Vou criar um modelo de documentação de wireframes abrangente, formatado em Markdown, focado em fluxos de desenvolvimento interno e adaptado ao uso de Shadcn com TailwindCSS v4. Ele incluirá todas as seções solicitadas com descrições orientadoras para facilitar o preenchimento por equipes de UX, produto e engenharia.

Já começo e te aviso assim que estiver pronto para revisão.


# **Wireframe Documentation Template**

*(This template is intended for documenting wireframes of internal tools, dashboards, or employee portals. It uses the **Shadcn UI** component library with **TailwindCSS v4** as the design system foundation. Each section below includes guidance in italics to help you fill out the details.)*

## Title Page

* **Project/Tool Name:** *\[Enter the name of the project or internal tool (e.g., "Employee Portal Dashboard")]*
* **Version:** *\[Document version or software release number (e.g., 1.0, 2.0-beta)]*
* **Date:** *\[Date of this document’s creation or last update (YYYY-MM-DD)]*
* **Author:** *\[Name of the document author and team/department (e.g., John Doe – UX Design)]*
* **Department:** *\[Department or team responsible for this project (e.g., IT Dept, HR Systems Team)]*

## Document Purpose & Scope

*Briefly describe **why** this wireframe documentation exists and **what** it covers.* For example, explain the purpose of the document (e.g., to communicate the design of a new internal dashboard feature) and outline the **scope** of the wireframes:

* *What system, feature, or workflow do these wireframes pertain to?*
* *Which parts of the project are **in scope** (covered by these wireframes)?*
* *Are there any areas explicitly **out of scope** (not covered here)?*

*(This section sets context for readers, so they know the focus and boundaries of the documented design.)*

## Stakeholders & Reviewers

*List the primary people involved who should review or are accountable for this wireframe design.* Include each person’s name, role, and department or team:

* **\[Name] – \[Role], \[Department]:** *e.g., Jane Smith – Product Manager, Operations*
* **\[Name] – \[Role], \[Department]:** *e.g., Bob Johnson – UX Designer, Product Design*
* **\[Name] – \[Role], \[Department]:** *...add as needed...*

*(These are the stakeholders who will provide feedback or sign-off on the wireframes. Make sure to include anyone from UX, Product, Engineering, etc., who has a say in the design.)*

## Wireframe Overview

*Provide a high-level overview of the wireframe set and the design approach.* This is a short summary that might include:

* **Design System & Approach:** Mention that the wireframes adhere to the Shadcn UI design system with TailwindCSS v4 for consistency (using standard components, spacing, and styles).
* **Key Goals:** Outline the primary goals or principles guiding these wireframes. *For example: improving user efficiency in an internal workflow, ensuring accessibility, or standardizing the UI for a new tool.*
* **Design Context:** Note any background that influenced the design (such as user research insights or specific internal guidelines).

*(Think of this as an introduction to the design. It should help UX, product, and engineering team members understand the overall intent behind the wireframes before diving into specifics.)*

## Page/Screen List

*Enumerate all the pages or screens that have been wireframed and are included in this document.* This serves as a quick index of the wireframes:

1. **\[Page/Screen Name 1]:** *Brief description or purpose (optional)*
2. **\[Page/Screen Name 2]:** *Brief description or purpose (optional)*
3. **\[Page/Screen Name 3]:** *Brief description or purpose (optional)*
   *...add more as needed...*

*(Each listed screen will be detailed in the next section. Include a short note next to each if it helps clarify what the screen is, but keep it concise.)*

---

**For each page/screen listed above, use the following template to document its details.** *Repeat this section for every wireframed page or screen.*

## \[Page/Screen Title]

*Provide the name of the page or screen as the heading above (e.g., **Dashboard – User Overview**).*

* **Wireframe Image/Link:** *Embed the wireframe image or provide a link to it.* (For example, attach a screenshot or add a link to the Figma frame or design file. Ensure the image is clear enough to read any annotations on it.)

* **Description & Purpose:** *Explain what this screen is for.* Describe the screen’s role in the application or workflow. *For example: "This screen allows HR managers to view a summary of team leave requests and approve or deny requests individually."* Mention the primary **user task** or goal associated with this screen.

* **Key Elements & Annotations:** *Identify the major UI components and any annotations on the wireframe.* List or describe important elements such as headers, menus, buttons, forms, tables, etc. If your wireframe uses reference markers or callouts (like numbered annotations), explain each one here. Wherever possible, refer to standard **Shadcn UI components** or TailwindCSS utility classes for clarity. *For example: "Uses a **Modal** component for the confirmation dialog," or "Primary action button styled as per Tailwind’s `btn-primary` class."* Include notes on any icons or images, and describe behavior (e.g., “Save button \[1] – on click, saves the form and shows a confirmation toast”).

* **User Flow/Interaction Notes:** *Describe how the user gets to this screen, what they can do here, and what happens next.* Explain the **context** of this screen in the workflow. *For example: "Users reach this screen after clicking ‘Manage Team’ on the dashboard. Here they can edit team member details. After saving changes, the user is returned to the dashboard view."* Note any important interactions like form submissions, navigation actions, or conditional elements (e.g., “This section is only visible to Admin users”).

* **Accessibility & Responsiveness Considerations:** *Describe how this screen’s design addresses accessibility and different devices.* For **accessibility**, mention things like keyboard navigation (e.g., tab order, access keys), screen reader labels or ARIA attributes for important elements, color contrast (ensuring text is readable on background), and any alt text for icons/images. For **responsiveness**, note how the layout adapts on smaller screens or different devices. *For example: "On mobile, the sidebar becomes a top dropdown menu," or "All buttons have visible focus states for keyboard users."* If using Shadcn UI components, remember they are built with accessibility in mind, but highlight any additional accessibility notes specific to your design.

* **Open Questions/Feedback:** *List any unresolved issues or points where you need input.* This can include things like: outstanding questions for stakeholders, assumptions that need validation, or features awaiting decisions. *For example: "Should we allow bulk approval of requests on this screen? (Pending confirmation from Product Team)", or "Color scheme needs accessibility review – awaiting feedback from UX."* Each point should ideally indicate who or what team feedback is needed from, if applicable.

*(End of template for this screen. Repeat the **\[Page/Screen Title]** section above for each additional wireframed page or screen in the project.)*

## Versioning & Change Log

*Document the history of updates to this wireframe documentation.* Each entry should include the date, the person making the change, and a summary of what changed:

* **YYYY-MM-DD – \[Name]:** *\[Describe the change made, e.g., Added new wireframe for Settings page; Updated annotations on Dashboard screen]*
* **YYYY-MM-DD – \[Name]:** *\[Describe the change, e.g., Revised scope to include feedback filtering feature]*

*...add additional entries for each revision of the document or design. The change log helps the team track how the wireframes and documentation have evolved over time.*

## Approval & Sign-off

*List the individuals who need to approve this document and the wireframes, along with their approval status.* Include name, role, and their sign-off status or date:

* **\[Name] – \[Role]:** *Approval Status (e.g., Approved on 2025-06-23, or Pending)*
* **\[Name] – \[Role]:** *Approval Status (e.g., Pending review)*
* **\[Name] – \[Role]:** *Approval Status (e.g., Approved)*

*(Typically, this includes project owners, team leads, or department heads. This section ensures everyone knows who has reviewed and given the green light for the designs to proceed.)*

---

*End of Wireframe Documentation Template.* Feel free to adjust, add, or remove sections to suit your project’s needs. This template is meant to **guide UX, product, and engineering teams** in creating clear and consistent wireframe documentation for internal development projects. Each section should be updated as the project evolves to maintain an accurate and useful reference. Enjoy your design process!
