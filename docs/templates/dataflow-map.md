## Document Purpose & Scope

*Describe the goal of this data flow mapping and what it covers.* For example, outline **why** this mapping is being created and **which** systems, internal tools, workflows, or business processes it encompasses. Clarify the boundaries of this document (what is in scope and what is out of scope).

## Stakeholders & Data Owners

*Identify all key stakeholders, data owners, and users involved in these data flows.* This should include anyone responsible for data at various stages or who depends on the data:

* **Business Owner(s):** \[Name/Role] – accountable for the process or tool, ensures it meets business needs.
* **Data Owner(s):** \[Name/Role] – owns the data sources or repositories, responsible for data quality and access.
* **Development Team:** \[Team/Role] – builds/maintains the workflow or tool (e.g., engineering, BI team).
* **Users/Consumers:** \[Role(s)] – who uses the outputs (e.g., analysts, internal users, automated processes).
* **Compliance/Security:** \[Role] – oversees data compliance, security, and governance for this flow.

## Overview & Context

*Provide a high-level overview of the workflow or process being mapped.* Describe the internal tool or process automation context and **why** data flows as described. Include background on how this fits into business operations (e.g., “This mapping supports the daily report dashboard for sales analytics”). Mention if the workflow includes multiple pipelines (e.g., a nightly batch process and a real-time update stream) to set context for the diagrams and descriptions below.

## Data Sources

*List and describe all input data sources feeding into this workflow.* Include databases, APIs, files, and any other origin of data:

* **ClickHouse** – e.g. specific ClickHouse database or tables that serve as primary data source (analytical data store from which data is extracted).
* **MCP Connector/Endpoint** – e.g. an MCP (Multi-Client/Model Context Protocol) service used to extract data or context from an external system or API on demand (serving as an extraction layer).
* **Internal API or Service** – e.g. internal microservice or API providing data (such as user activity API, etc.).
* **User Input** – e.g. manual input or configuration provided via an internal tool or form that initiates or influences the data flow.
* **Files/External Data** – e.g. CSV upload, flat files, or third-party data sources that are ingested into the system.

## Data Destinations

*List where the data ends up or is consumed.* Include databases, dashboards, reports, or downstream systems that use the processed data:

* **Internal Dashboard/Tool** – e.g. an internal dashboard or UI where processed data is visualized (specify name if applicable).
* **Database/Data Warehouse** – e.g. a ClickHouse cluster or other database where transformed data is stored for querying (could be the same as source if data is updated, or another repository).
* **Downstream Systems** – e.g. other internal systems or services that receive data (via API calls, webhooks, etc., e.g. a CRM or ERP system updated with results).
* **Reports/Exports** – e.g. scheduled reports, email summaries, or file exports (CSV, PDF) that are generated from this data flow.
* **Data Lake/Archive** – e.g. long-term storage where data is archived or logs are kept for compliance.

## Data Flow Diagram(s)

*Visualize the data movement from sources to destinations.* The diagram should illustrate all major steps, transformations, and decision points. Use a Mermaid diagram for clarity. If both batch and real-time pipelines are present, consider providing separate diagrams or clearly labeling each flow in one diagram. For example:

```mermaid
%% Example Data Flow Diagram (replace with actual flow)
flowchart LR
    subgraph Batch_Flow [Batch Data Pipeline]
        A[Source A (e.g., ClickHouse)] --> B[Step 1: Extract & Validate]
        B --> C[Step 2: Transform Data]
        C --> D[Destination X (e.g., Dashboard DB)]
    end
    subgraph RealTime_Flow [Real-time Data Pipeline]
        X[Source B (e.g., API/MCP)] --> Y[Step 1: Ingest Event]
        Y --> Z[Step 2: Stream Processing]
        Z --> D[Destination X (Dashboard DB)]
    end
```

*Replace the above placeholder with your actual data flow diagram(s). Ensure every source, process, and destination mentioned is represented.* Use labels to denote key transformations or decisions (e.g., filtering, branching).

## Step-by-Step Data Flow Description

*Describe each step of the data flow in sequence, aligning with the diagram above.* For each step, include what data is involved, how it’s processed or transformed, and how it moves to the next stage. If there are separate batch vs. streaming flows, you may describe them in separate sub-lists or note the differences within the steps.

1. **Step 1 – Data Extraction:** Describe how data is extracted from the source. (For example: The system queries the **ClickHouse** database or calls an **MCP endpoint** to retrieve raw data. Basic validation checks might occur here to ensure the query results or incoming files meet expected format/schema.)
2. **Step 2 – Validation & Cleaning:** Describe data validation and cleaning. (For example: Validate required fields, filter out records failing quality rules, and clean or normalize data such as converting timestamps to a standard format.)
3. **Step 3 – Transformation/Enrichment:** Describe any transformation or enrichment. (For example: Join data with reference tables, calculate new metrics, enrich records with additional context from another API or MCP service, and prepare the data structure needed for output.)
4. **Step 4 – Loading/Delivery:** Describe how data is loaded to its destination or delivered. (For example: Insert the transformed data into the **dashboard database** or data warehouse, update an internal tool via API, or produce a report. If real-time, this could be pushing an event to a message queue or invoking a webhook to a downstream system.)

*Continue numbering subsequent steps as needed for the entire flow. Ensure each major process identified in the diagram is explained.* Include any decision points or branching logic (e.g., "if data quality check fails, send to error queue, else continue to next step").

## Data Transformation & Validation

*Detail all major data transformations, business rules, and validation logic applied throughout the flow.* This section provides a deeper dive into how data is modified or checked at various steps:

* **Data Mapping & Conversion:** Explain how data is mapped from source to destination schema. (E.g., mapping fields, converting data types or formats such as date formats, merging multiple source fields into one, etc.)
* **Calculation & Derivation:** Note any calculated fields or metrics. (E.g., computing a KPI, aggregating values by day, deriving categories from raw data.)
* **Enrichment:** Specify any enrichment steps. (E.g., adding lookup information from another service or database, enhancing records with metadata from an MCP call or reference table.)
* **Validation Rules:** List key data quality checks. (E.g., “OrderID must be present and not null”, “Timestamp must be within the last 24h for real-time processing”, or uniqueness constraints, etc. Specify how invalid data is handled—filtered out, corrected, or sent to error handling.)
* **Business Rules:** Highlight any conditional logic. (E.g., “If user is internal, route data to internal database; if external, use different pipeline” or any domain-specific rules that affect flow.)

## Data Integration & Interfaces

*List the integration points, interfaces, and jobs that enable data movement in this workflow.* Include any tools, protocols, or scheduled jobs responsible for extracting, transferring, or loading data between components:

* **Batch Jobs/ETL Processes:** Describe scheduled jobs (ETL/ELT) that move or transform data in batches. (E.g., a nightly cron job or Airflow task that pulls data from ClickHouse and loads it into a dashboard table; a daily export-import routine, etc.)
* **Real-Time Ingestion:** Describe streaming or API integrations for real-time data. (E.g., a webhook or event listener that triggers whenever new data arrives, a Kafka topic or message queue subscription that streams data into the pipeline, or an API endpoint that receives data in real-time.)
* **APIs and Services:** List any internal or external APIs used. (E.g., internal service endpoints called during the flow for additional data or actions, third-party APIs for enrichment. Include MCP-based APIs if applicable, such as an MCP server that interfaces with ClickHouse or other systems to fetch data on demand.)
* **Interfaces/Protocols:** Mention any specific interfaces like **MCP servers**, SDKs, or database connectors. (E.g., use of a Python client for ClickHouse, JDBC/ODBC connections, or specialized connectors for data transfer. If MCP is used as a protocol layer, note how it integrates—for instance, "Data is requested via an MCP server which executes read-only queries on ClickHouse".)
* **Data Pipeline Tools:** If using any pipeline/orchestration tools (e.g., Apache Airflow, Kubernetes CronJobs, Fivetran, etc.), mention how they coordinate the above interfaces.

## Data Security & Compliance

*Describe how data is protected and compliance is ensured throughout the flow.* Include measures for both data-in-transit and data-at-rest, as well as access control and auditing:

* **Encryption (In-Transit & At-Rest):** Explain how data is encrypted during transfer and when stored. (E.g., “Data in transit between components is secured via TLS 1.2; all sensitive data at rest in ClickHouse and data lake is encrypted using AES-256.” If using MCP or API calls, note that those communications are also over secure channels like HTTPS.)
* **Access Control:** Describe who can access the data and how rights are managed. (E.g., “Only authorized service accounts can query the ClickHouse source; role-based access control is enforced on the dashboard so only certain departments can view sensitive fields.” Mention use of API keys, OAuth tokens, or other authentication for interfaces like MCP servers or APIs.)
* **Compliance & Privacy:** Note any compliance requirements considered. (E.g., GDPR, CCPA, or internal data handling policies. “Personal data is masked or omitted in the analytics output,” or “Consent is obtained for user data and logs are pseudonymized.”)
* **Logging & Auditing:** Explain how activities are logged. (E.g., “All data extraction and load operations are logged with timestamps and user/service IDs. An audit log is maintained for who accessed what data via the internal tool.” This ensures traceability for troubleshooting and compliance audits.)
* **Data Retention:** (Optional) Mention policies on data retention or deletion if relevant. (E.g., “Raw logs are retained for 30 days in the data lake and then purged.”)

## Error Handling & Exception Management

*Explain how errors and exceptions are handled in the data flow.* This includes how the system detects issues, how it responds, and how those issues are escalated or resolved:

* **Detection:** Describe how the system catches errors or anomalies. (E.g., built-in validation errors triggering on bad data formats, try/catch blocks around API calls, or monitoring systems detecting job failures.)
* **Logging & Monitoring:** Explain how errors are logged and monitored. (E.g., “Errors are written to an error log table or sent to a monitoring service (like Sentry/Datadog). Each failure includes a timestamp, error code, and data context for debugging.”)
* **Alerts/Notifications:** Describe how the team is alerted. (E.g., “On critical failures, an alert is sent to the on-call engineering team via email/Slack. Dashboard shows error status if data is stale.”)
* **Recovery & Retry:** Explain any automated recovery. (E.g., “The system will retry the API call up to 3 times with exponential backoff in case of transient errors. Failed batch jobs can be re-run manually the next morning, or automatically flagged for reprocessing in the next cycle.”)
* **Manual Intervention:** Note how exceptions that cannot be auto-resolved are handled. (E.g., “Data that fails validation is routed to a quarantine table for manual review. The data team receives a ticket to investigate and clean the data before re-inserting it.”)
* **Fallback Procedures:** If applicable, mention any fallback. (E.g., “If real-time feed fails, the system falls back to the last successful dataset or switches to a backup source to ensure continuity.”)

## Performance & Volume Considerations

*Document the expected data volumes and performance requirements, and how the system is designed to handle them:*

* **Data Volume:** Indicate the scale of data the pipeline handles. (E.g., “\~5 million records per day batch input” or “streaming \~200 messages per minute”. If ClickHouse is used, note its capacity or any sharding approach to handle volume.)
* **Velocity & Latency:** Note real-time vs batch expectations. (E.g., “Real-time events are processed within 2 seconds end-to-end for immediate dashboard updates; batch processing completes within 1 hour after midnight each day.” Specify any SLAs or critical latency requirements.)
* **Performance Tuning:** Describe how performance is ensured. (E.g., “Using ClickHouse for its fast OLAP query performance to aggregate large datasets quickly. Queries are optimized with appropriate indexes or materialized views. The ETL jobs run on a cluster to parallelize processing.”)
* **Scalability:** Mention how the system scales with load. (E.g., “The pipeline is horizontally scalable: we can add more workers for the transformation step or scale up the ClickHouse cluster nodes to handle growth. Streaming consumers can be load-balanced.”)
* **Resource Use:** Note any resource or performance constraints. (E.g., “Batch jobs are scheduled during off-peak hours to reduce impact on the source database. Memory usage is monitored to prevent OOM errors on large files.”)
* **Testing & Monitoring:** (Optional) Mention any load testing or performance monitoring in place. (E.g., “Regular load tests are done to ensure the system can handle 2x anticipated volume. Dashboards track processing time and throughput, alerting if thresholds exceed.”)

## Assumptions & Constraints

*List any assumptions made during the design of this data flow and any constraints that affect it:*

* **Assumptions:** (E.g., “Source data in ClickHouse is assumed to be available by 6 AM daily,” “All IDs in the data are unique,” “External API (accessed via MCP) is expected to have >99% uptime.” State assumptions about data quality, availability, or dependencies that the flow relies on.)
* **Technical Constraints:** (E.g., “The process must use only on-premise infrastructure due to policy,” “ClickHouse cluster has a 1TB storage limit,” “The transformation job must complete within a 2-hour window due to upstream dependency,” or constraints like legacy systems that limit integration methods.)
* **Business Constraints:** (E.g., “Compliance requires data not leave region X,” “Team only available to support pipeline during business hours,” “Budget limits the use of cloud services, so we cannot employ certain managed services.”)
* **Scope Limitations:** (E.g., “This mapping does not cover data flows beyond the marketing department’s tools,” “Real-time pipeline covers only critical events, not all events.” Any known gaps or intentionally excluded aspects should be noted so readers understand the limits of this document.)
