Great. I’ll create a clear, concise, and general-purpose User Story Template formatted in Markdown, tailored for internal development workflows. It will include all specified sections—each with guiding descriptions—to help product, engineering, and business teams document and prioritize internal tools effectively.

I'll let you know as soon as the template is ready.
