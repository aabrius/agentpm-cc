Perfeito. Vou criar um template abrangente de Jornada do UsuÃ¡rio focado em workflows internos (como ferramentas internas, dashboards e portais para colaboradores), usando formataÃ§Ã£o em Markdown, um exemplo de diagrama visual em MermaidJS e uma versÃ£o em YAML para preenchimento estruturado.

JÃ¡ inicio a montagem e te trago o conteÃºdo completo em instantes.


# Internal Tool User Journey Template

## Journey Title

*Provide a clear name or identifier for this user journey (e.g., "Employee Onboarding Process").*

## Persona

*Which internal user persona or employee group is this journey based on? Describe their role, goals, and needs (e.g., "New Hire", "IT Support Engineer", "HR Manager").*

## Scenario / Context

*What is the business process, workflow, or situation being mapped? Why is it important? Outline the context and objectives. (For example: "Onboarding a new employee into all relevant internal systems â€“ this is crucial to ensure productivity from Day 1.")*

## Journey Stages / Steps

*Break down the journey into discrete stages or steps. For each step, include the following details:*

1. **Step 1 Name** â€“ *Brief description of what happens in this step.*

   * **User Actions:** What does the user do at this step? (e.g., fills out a form, requests access)
   * **System Actions:** What does the system/tool do in response? (e.g., sends confirmation email, logs the request)
   * **Entry Criteria:** Conditions that must be met to begin this step (e.g., user has an active account, user received an invite).
   * **Exit Criteria:** Conditions that signify this step is complete (e.g., user successfully logged in, request is submitted and acknowledged).
   * **Pain Points & Frustrations:** What challenges might the user encounter here? (e.g., confusing UI, slow load times, lack of guidance).
   * **Opportunities & Recommendations:** How could this step be improved? (e.g., streamlining the form, adding tooltips, automating a sub-task).
   * **Success Indicators:** How do we measure success for this step? (e.g., time to complete the step, error rate, user satisfaction feedback).

2. **Step 2 Name** â€“ *Brief description of what happens in this step.*

   * **User Actions:** What does the user do at this step?
   * **System Actions:** What does the system/tool do in response?
   * **Entry Criteria:** Prerequisites for this step to start.
   * **Exit Criteria:** How do we know this step is finished?
   * **Pain Points & Frustrations:** Challenges or friction in this step.
   * **Opportunities & Recommendations:** Suggestions to improve this step.
   * **Success Indicators:** Metrics or signs of a successful step.

*Continue listing steps as needed for the entire journey.*

## Emotions & Experience Mapping

*Describe the userâ€™s emotional journey through each stage. Note highs, lows, points of confusion or delight.*

* **Step 1:** *\[Emotion]* â€“ Why does the user feel this way? (e.g., ðŸ˜€ **Excited** â€“ the interface is new and engaging.)
* **Step 2:** *\[Emotion]* â€“ Rationale for this emotion (e.g., ðŸ˜• **Confused** â€“ instructions are unclear at this stage.)
* **Step 3:** *\[Emotion]* â€“ ...and so on for each step in the journey.

*Optionally, you can visualize this as an emotional curve chart, illustrating peaks (positive experiences) and valleys (pain points) across the journey.*

## Visual Journey Map

*High-level flow of the journey steps and transitions (using MermaidJS for a flowchart).*

    B --> C[Step 3: Name]
    %% Use MermaidJS syntax to expand this diagram as needed for your journey %%
```

## Supporting Systems & Integrations

*List any systems, teams, or processes that intersect with this journey (internal tools, databases, APIs, departments involved, etc.). For each, you may include a brief note on how they are involved.*

* **System/Tool 1:** *Role or interaction in this journey (e.g., "HR Onboarding Portal â€“ used to enter new hire data").*
* **System/Tool 2:** *Role or interaction (e.g., "Email Service â€“ sends notification to IT support").*
* **Team/Dept 1:** *Involved team and their role (e.g., "IT Support Team â€“ provisions hardware at Step 3").*

## Assumptions & Constraints

*Document any assumptions, rules, or limitations we are making in this journey.*

* *Assumption:* e.g., "All users have single sign-on (SSO) access by the start of this journey."
* *Assumption:* e.g., "User has completed required training before Step 2."
* *Constraint:* e.g., "System updates can only be deployed during off-hours, affecting Step 4 timing."
* *Constraint:* e.g., "Limited support staff available on weekends, which may slow the process."

## Revision History

*Track changes to this journey map over time.*
