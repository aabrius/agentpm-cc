Great. I’ll create a comprehensive Design Requirements Document (DRD) template in Markdown format, tailored for general-purpose internal development workflows such as dashboards, employee portals, and internal tools. Each section will include clear labels and concise descriptions or guiding questions to help product, UX, and engineering teams document and align effectively.


# \[Project/Tool Name] Design Requirements Document

**Version:** \[e.g., 1.0]
**Date:** \[YYYY-MM-DD]
**Author:** \[Your Name, Role]
**Department:** \[Department or Team Name]

## Document Purpose & Scope

* What is the purpose of this design document, and which internal system, tool, or workflow does it address?
* What are the objectives of this document, and what problems or needs is it intended to solve?
* Define the scope of the design: what aspects or features are included (in scope) and what aspects are explicitly not included (out of scope)?

## Stakeholders & Internal Users

* Who are the key stakeholders and end users of this tool?
* What are their roles and primary needs, and do they have any specific accessibility requirements or constraints?

## Design Goals & Principles

* What are the primary goals for the user experience of this tool (e.g., improve efficiency, reduce errors, increase user satisfaction)?
* What key design principles will guide the work (e.g., usability, accessibility standards, consistency with existing internal tools, efficiency in workflows)?

## Context & Current State

* What is the current state of the system or workflow (if one exists)? Briefly describe any existing design or process currently in use.
* What problems, pain points, or improvement opportunities have been identified in the current state that this new design aims to address?

## User Personas & Scenarios

* Who are the main user types (personas) for this tool, and what are their roles and goals? (Describe each key persona’s job role, responsibilities, and what they need from the tool.)
* What are the typical scenarios or use cases for these users? What tasks do they perform, and what challenges or pain points might they experience in those scenarios?

## Functional Requirements

* What key functions or tasks must the design enable for users? List the core features or capabilities the tool needs to provide.
* What primary workflows or user journeys should be supported? (Describe the main tasks step-by-step, or list user stories that the design should accommodate.)

## Visual & Interaction Design Requirements

* What are the requirements for the **visual design**? Consider the overall look and feel, layout and spacing, visual hierarchy of information, branding guidelines (colors, logos), typography (fonts, sizes), and use of icons or imagery.
* What are the requirements for the **interaction design**? Describe how users will interact with the interface, including navigation patterns (e.g., menus, buttons, shortcuts), form behaviors (validations, error messages), interactive feedback (hover states, loading indicators, animations), and general usability considerations.
* Are there any existing style guides or design systems that the design should follow? (For example, an internal company design system or established UI component library.)

## Information Architecture & Navigation

* What is the structure of the information and content in this tool? Outline the information architecture, including the main sections or pages/screens and how they are organized hierarchically.
* How will users navigate through the tool? Describe the primary navigation elements (e.g., menus, sidebar, breadcrumbs) and user flow between major sections. You may include or reference a site map or user flow diagram if available to illustrate the structure and navigation.

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

* What accessibility standards or guidelines must the design meet (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance or relevant internal accessibility policies)?
* How will the design accommodate users with different abilities and needs? (Consider measures such as keyboard-only navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, text alternatives for images, and accommodating other assistive technologies.)

## Responsive & Adaptive Design

* Does the tool need to support multiple device types or screen sizes (e.g., desktop monitors, tablets, mobile phones)?
* If yes, what are the requirements for responsive or adaptive design to ensure the tool works well across these environments? (For example, describe how layouts should adjust, any critical breakpoints, or if a separate design is needed for certain devices.)

## Content Requirements

* What content needs to be created or included as part of the UI? List specific text elements such as field labels, button labels, instructions, error/validation messages, success confirmations, tooltips, and any on-screen help content.
* Are there guidelines for the tone or terminology to use? (For instance, should the language be formal or casual? Should you use specific internal terminology or acronyms? Note any style guide for content or messaging that the design should adhere to.)

## Prototyping & Validation Plan

* How will the design be prototyped and iterated? (e.g., will you create wireframes, low-fidelity sketches, or interactive high-fidelity prototypes in a tool like Figma before development?)
* How will the design be tested and validated with users? Outline any plans for usability testing or feedback sessions with internal users or stakeholders (for example, conducting user testing on the prototype, collecting feedback via surveys or interviews, and iterating based on results).

## Success Metrics

* How will we measure the success of this design once it is implemented?
* What metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) will indicate that the design is effective? (For example, improvements in task completion time, reduction in user errors, higher user satisfaction ratings, increased adoption or usage rates among target users, etc.)

## Assumptions & Constraints

* What assumptions are we making about this project, the users, or the environment? (For example, assume users have a certain level of technical knowledge, or assume the tool will only be used on the company network, etc.)
* What constraints or dependencies could impact the design? (These might include technical constraints like using specific software or legacy systems, compliance or security requirements, time and budget limitations, or dependencies on other projects or teams.)

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

* What potential risks or challenges have been identified that could affect the design’s success? (e.g., risk of low user adoption, changing requirements, tight timeline, technical integration difficulties.)
* For each identified risk, what is the plan to mitigate or address it? (For example, provide training to users to encourage adoption, schedule regular check-ins to manage scope changes, do a technical proof-of-concept early to de-risk integration issues, etc.)

## Revision History

*(Use this section to track major changes to the document over time. Update the version number, date, description of changes, and author whenever significant revisions are made.)*

| Version | Date       | Description                   | Author         |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| 0.1     | YYYY-MM-DD | Initial draft of the document | \[Author Name] |
| 1.0     | YYYY-MM-DD | Finalized requirements        | \[Author Name] |

## Approval & Sign-off

* Who must review and approve this design document before implementation can proceed? List the approvers (name and role) who need to sign off on the design. For example:

  * \[Approver Name, Role] – Approved on \[Date]
  * \[Approver Name, Role] – Approved on \[Date]
