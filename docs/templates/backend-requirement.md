Perfeito. Vou criar um modelo de documento de requisitos de backend (BRD) genérico, adequado para fluxos de trabalho internos de desenvolvimento, com exemplos embutidos e formatação em Markdown. Já volto com o material para sua revisão.


# **Backend Requirements Document (BRD) Template**

## Title Page

Provide the basic information about the document and project. Include the project name, document version, date, and author(s) or owner(s) of the document.

> **Project Name:** *e.g., Payment Processing Backend Service*
> **Document Version:** *e.g., 1.0 (Draft)*
> **Date:** *e.g., 2025-06-23*
> **Author:** *e.g., Jane Doe (Backend Team Lead)*

---

## Document Purpose & Scope

**Purpose:** Explain *why* this document exists. What is the goal of the document, and what audience is it for? Provide a brief statement of the document’s intent (e.g., to define requirements for a new backend system).

**Scope:** Define *what* this backend system will cover. Outline the functionalities and areas that are **in-scope**, and note any major aspects that are **out-of-scope** (excluded) to set clear boundaries.

> *Example:* This document describes the requirements for the **Order Processing Backend Service**. It covers all backend functionalities: order intake API, payment processing integration, and inventory update events. Front-end application details and UI/UX design are **out of scope** for this document.

---

## Stakeholders & Internal Users

List the key people and teams involved. Identify **stakeholders** (those who care about or influence the project) and **internal users** (who will directly use or support the system). Include roles such as product owners, developers, QA, DevOps, support teams, etc., along with their names or team names.

> *Example Stakeholders:*
>
> * **Product Manager:** Coordinates requirements and feature priorities.
> * **Technical Lead:** Oversees architecture and development decisions.
> * **DevOps Team:** Manages infrastructure, deployment, and monitoring.
> * **Customer Support Team:** Uses admin tools and logs to help troubleshoot user issues.

---

## Business Context & Background

Provide context on the **business need** and any background information. Explain why this system is being developed and how it fits into the bigger picture. Mention any relevant historical decisions, previous systems being replaced, or business goals driving this project.

> *Example:* The company is expanding internationally, requiring a scalable payment system to handle increased volume. The new backend will replace a **legacy monolithic system** that struggles with performance and cannot easily support new features. This project is critical for meeting Q4 growth targets and improving customer checkout experience.

---

## System Overview

Give a **high-level overview** of the backend system. Summarize the system’s architecture and main components, without going into low-level details. You might describe the overall design (e.g., microservices vs. monolith), key modules, and how data flows through the system. If applicable, mention any high-level system diagram or architecture diagram here (and include it in an appendix or separate file if needed).

> *Example:* The **Order Processing System** consists of three main components: (1) a REST API service that accepts client requests, (2) a background worker service for processing long-running tasks (like payment transactions), and (3) a PostgreSQL database for persistence. These components communicate via an internal message queue (RabbitMQ) for event processing. The system is deployed as containerized microservices and will integrate with other internal services (e.g., User Auth Service) as depicted in the architecture diagram below. *(Diagram not shown in template)*

---

## Functional Requirements

Detail the **functional requirements** – the specific capabilities and behaviors the backend system must have. Each requirement should describe an action or feature from a user or system perspective. You can list them as bullet points or user stories. Ensure they are clear and testable.

> *Examples:*
>
> * **User Account Management:** The system shall allow creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of user accounts.
> * **Order Processing:** The system shall accept new orders via API and queue them for processing. Upon successful payment, it shall mark orders as confirmed.
> * **Inventory Update:** The system shall consume inventory update events from a message queue and adjust stock levels in the database accordingly.
> * **Reporting:** The system shall generate a daily sales summary and expose it via an internal API for the analytics team.

---

## API Specifications

If the backend provides APIs (e.g., REST, GraphQL), list each **endpoint or interface** with details. For REST/HTTP APIs, specify the endpoint URL, HTTP method, request parameters, and response format. For event-driven systems, describe the events (message topics, schemas) or any other interfaces (like gRPC endpoints or CLI commands). Use a consistent format to make it easy to read and fill in.

> **Example REST API Endpoint:**
>
> ```http
> POST /api/v1/orders
> ```
>
> **Description:** Create a new order in the system.
> **Request Body (JSON):**
>
> ```json
> {
>   "customerId": 98765,
>   "items": [
>     { "productId": "ABC123", "quantity": 2 },
>     { "productId": "XYZ999", "quantity": 1 }
>   ]
> }
> ```
>
> **Response:** `201 Created`
>
> ```json
> {
>   "orderId": 12345,
>   "status": "pending",
>   "createdAt": "2025-06-23T12:00:00Z"
> }
> ```
>
> *(Fill out similar details for each API endpoint, event message, or interface method as applicable.)*

---

## Data Management & Persistence

Describe how the system will manage and store data. Identify the primary **database(s)** or storage systems (SQL, NoSQL, file storage, etc.) and what they are used for. Mention key data **models or entities** and any important relationships. Include details about data volumes, growth expectations, and any caching or data retention strategies. If relevant, note how backups or migrations will be handled.

> *Example:* This service uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary data store for all persistent data (e.g., user profiles, orders, transactions). Key tables include `Users`, `Orders`, and `Payments` with relational links (each Order is linked to a User and one or more Payment records). A **Redis cache** is used to store session data and recent lookup results to improve read performance. All sensitive data (like passwords or payment tokens) is encrypted in the database. Data retention policy: logs and audit records will be stored for 1 year, after which they are archived to an S3 bucket.

---

## Integration & External Interfaces

List and describe any **external systems or services** the backend will interact with, as well as internal interfaces to other components or microservices. For each integration, mention the purpose and method of communication. This could include third-party APIs, internal services, message queues, webhooks, etc. Specify details like protocols (REST, gRPC, messaging), authentication for external calls, and key data exchanged.

> *Example Integrations:*
>
> * **Payment Gateway (Stripe API):** Used to charge customer credit cards. The backend will call Stripe’s REST API (`/v1/charges`) for payment processing. Requires API keys and uses HTTPS for security.
> * **Email Service:** Integrates with an internal **Email Notification Service** via a RESTful API to send order confirmation emails. On order completion, this backend calls the email service’s `/sendEmail` endpoint with order details.
> * **Inventory Service (Internal):** Consumes messages from the `inventory_updates` RabbitMQ queue. Whenever an order is confirmed, this backend publishes a message to update inventory counts in the Inventory Service.
> * **Analytics Pipeline:** Sends a copy of order data to an analytics system via a Kafka topic `orders.created` for offline processing.

---

## Security & Compliance

Specify the **security requirements** for the backend and any compliance or regulatory standards that apply. Describe how the system will handle **authentication** (e.g., OAuth2, JWT, API keys) and **authorization** (e.g., role-based access control). Include requirements for **data protection**: encryption in transit (SSL/TLS), encryption at rest, and secure storage of secrets (like API keys, credentials). Also note any compliance frameworks or regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.) the system must adhere to, and how logging/auditing will be done for security events.

> *Example:* All API endpoints must require a valid **JWT access token** issued by our Identity Provider for authentication. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** will restrict certain API operations (e.g., only admins can access the `/admin/*` endpoints). Data in transit will be encrypted via **HTTPS**; sensitive personal data (PII) in the database will be encrypted at rest using AES-256. The system will maintain an **audit log** of user actions (e.g., record when orders are created or updated, with user IDs). We must also comply with **GDPR** – for example, providing the ability to delete or anonymize user data upon request – and follow PCI-DSS guidelines for handling payment information (credit card data will not be stored directly on our servers).

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

Outline the critical **non-functional requirements (NFRs)** that the backend must meet. These include qualities and constraints such as performance, scalability, availability, reliability, maintainability, and usability (if relevant to any admin interfaces or developer experience). Be specific by providing target metrics or objectives for each of these where possible.

> *Example NFRs:*
>
> * **Performance:** The API should handle at least **1000 requests per second** with an average response time of **< 200ms** for retrieve operations.
> * **Scalability:** The system must support **horizontal scaling**. It should be able to scale out to handle a 10x increase in load (users or transactions) with minimal manual intervention.
> * **Availability:** Target **99.9% uptime** for the service (no more than \~8 hours of downtime per year). Implement clustering and use multiple availability zones to eliminate single points of failure.
> * **Reliability:** The system should gracefully handle component failures (e.g., if the database or a downstream service is temporarily unavailable) and have retry mechanisms for transient errors.
> * **Maintainability:** The codebase should be modular, well-documented, and have at least 80% unit test coverage to facilitate easy updates and onboarding of new developers. Logging and monitoring should be in place to simplify troubleshooting.
>   *(Add any other relevant NFRs such as security, compliance (if not covered above), and usability if there's an admin UI or developer-facing components.)*

---

## Error Handling & Logging

Describe how the system will handle errors and exceptions, and how it will log important events. Define the strategy for **error responses**: for example, standard HTTP status codes and a consistent error response format (structure of error messages returned by APIs). Also outline the **logging approach**: what will be logged (e.g., errors, warnings, info traces, audit events), log format or structure, and where the logs will be recorded (console, files, centralized logging system, etc.). Mention any monitoring or alerting related to errors (like sending alerts on critical failures).

> *Example:* The API will return meaningful error responses with an error code and message. For instance, a validation failure might return HTTP 400 with a JSON body containing `"error": "InvalidRequest"` and a descriptive `"message"`. The system will implement global exception handlers to catch unhandled errors and return a standardized error response.
> **Logging:** The backend will use a structured logging framework (e.g., JSON-formatted logs) to log events. Each log entry will include a timestamp, log level, service name, and a message. Critical errors (level **ERROR**) will trigger alerts through the monitoring system.

> *Example log entry:*
>
> ```text
> ERROR 2025-06-23T12:00:00Z [OrderService] Order 12345 failed payment: Payment gateway timeout.
> ```

*(In the above log example, the format is: Level, timestamp, \[service/component], and an error message. Your actual log format may differ.)*

---

## Assumptions & Constraints

List any **assumptions** and **constraints** identified for the project. **Assumptions** are conditions believed to be true without proof – these could be about how the system will be used or external conditions (e.g., "users will have a stable internet connection" or "the third-party API will be available"). **Constraints** are limitations that restrict your design or implementation choices – they can be technical (e.g., "must use AWS cloud services"), business-driven (e.g., "must launch by a certain date"), or related to compliance and standards.

> *Examples:*
>
> * *Assumption:* Users will already have an account in the system (no need to handle sign-ups in this service).
> * *Assumption:* The upstream Data Service will provide product information via API, so this backend will not need its own product database.
> * *Constraint:* The solution must run on the company’s existing **Kubernetes cluster** and conform to its operational standards.
> * *Constraint:* Only open-source libraries approved by the security team can be used (to meet compliance requirements).
> * *Constraint:* The system must comply with **data residency laws**, meaning all user data remains in EU data centers.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

Describe the plan for **testing** the backend and ensuring quality. Identify the different types of tests that will be performed and the tools or frameworks for each, such as unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, performance testing, and security testing. Include any specific targets or policies (e.g., code coverage requirements, continuous integration setup). Also mention any **Quality Assurance (QA)** processes like code reviews, manual testing, or use of QA engineers for exploratory testing.

> *Testing Strategy Examples:*
>
> * **Unit Testing:** Use a framework like Jest (for Node.js) or JUnit (for Java) to write unit tests for all core logic. Aim for at least *80% code coverage*.
> * **Integration Testing:** Develop integration tests that start the service (or use test containers) and verify API endpoints against a test database. These tests will run in a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) on each commit.
> * **End-to-End Testing:** Perform end-to-end tests in a staging environment, simulating real user workflows (for example, creating an order, processing payment, verifying inventory update). Tools like Postman or Cypress can automate these flows.
> * **Performance Testing:** Use JMeter or Locust to simulate load and ensure the system meets performance requirements (e.g., 100 concurrent users, spike tests). Identify the system’s breaking points and verify it auto-scales as expected.
> * **Security Testing:** Conduct security scans (using tools like OWASP ZAP) and, if possible, a penetration test to identify vulnerabilities. Ensure no OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities are present before release.
> * **QA Process:** All code changes require at least one peer **code review**. A QA engineer will perform exploratory testing on new features in the staging environment. Bug tracking and test results will be documented in Jira.

## Deployment & Release Strategy

Explain how the system will be **deployed** and released to different environments (development, testing, production). Describe the **infrastructure** and deployment process: e.g., using Docker containers, VMs, or serverless; what cloud or data center; how configuration is managed. Mention the CI/CD pipeline or automation for deployment. Also outline the **release strategy**: for instance, will you use continuous deployment, manual approvals for production, blue-green or canary deployments to minimize downtime, feature toggles for gradual rollouts, etc. Include any environment-specific considerations (such as feature flags enabled only in staging).

> *Example:* The backend will be packaged as a **Docker container** and deployed on **Kubernetes**. We will have three environments: **Dev** (for developers’ local use and CI automated testing), **Staging** (for QA and UAT testing, mirroring production setup), and **Production**. Deployment is handled via a **CI/CD pipeline** (e.g., GitLab CI): on each merge to main, the pipeline runs tests and then deploys to Staging. Production releases are manual and will use a **blue-green deployment** strategy — we deploy a new version alongside the old, run health checks, then switch traffic over. This approach allows quick rollback if something goes wrong. We also use **feature flags** (via LaunchDarkly) to gradually enable new features in production without full redeploys. Configuration (like database connection strings, API keys) is managed via Kubernetes secrets and config maps, separate from the application code.

---

## Maintenance & Support Plan

Detail the plan for **maintaining** the system after it’s live and how support will be provided. This includes setting up **monitoring** and alerting (what tools and what metrics will be watched), defining an on-call or support rotation for handling incidents, and routine maintenance tasks (like backups, updates, and performance tuning). Mention any **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** or support expectations (e.g., critical bug fix turnaround times) if they exist. If applicable, list any documentation or runbooks that will help the support team.

> *Example:* We will use **monitoring tools** (e.g., Prometheus with Grafana dashboards) to continuously track key metrics such as request rates, error rates, and latency. Alerts will be configured (through PagerDuty or email) to notify the on-call engineer if critical thresholds are exceeded (for instance, if error rate > 5% or CPU usage > 90% for 5 minutes). There will be a weekly on-call rotation among backend engineers to handle after-hours incidents. **Routine maintenance** tasks include nightly database backups (with backups stored on AWS S3 and verified monthly) and monthly library/security updates. We will maintain a **runbook** for common issues (e.g., how to restart services, how to handle database failover) to aid rapid response. The team’s goal is to respond to critical incidents within 15 minutes and resolve high-priority issues within 4 hours (per our internal SLA).
