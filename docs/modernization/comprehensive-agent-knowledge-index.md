## Migration Strategy Summary

### Phase 1: Knowledge Preservation ✓ (Completed)
All 9 agents have been thoroughly documented with:
- Core competencies and domain expertise
- Question frameworks and validation logic
- Template structures and content
- LLM integration patterns
- Quality assurance frameworks

### Phase 2: CrewAI Architecture Design (Next Steps)
1. **Agent Conversion Pattern**:
   ```python
   agent = Agent(
       role='[Specialist Role]',
       goal='[Primary Objective]',
       backstory='[Expertise Description]',
       tools=[custom_tools],
       llm=Claude35Sonnet(),
       verbose=True
   )
   ```

2. **Tool Requirements** (54 tools identified):
   - Document generation tools (9 types)
   - Validation and quality assurance tools
   - Question generation and management tools
   - Integration and collaboration tools
   - Visualization tools (Mermaid, diagrams)

3. **Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Maintain 4-phase workflow structure
   - Implement CrewAI task chains for agent collaboration
   - Preserve conversation state management
   - Enable dynamic agent selection based on intent

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Template Preservation**: All 17 document templates must be converted to CrewAI-compatible formats
2. **Question Logic**: 74 questions with validation rules must be maintained
3. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent's unique expertise must be preserved
4. **Workflow Integrity**: 4-phase workflow must function identically in CrewAI
5. **Quality Standards**: Validation thresholds and completion criteria must be enforced

## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority
1. Orchestrator routing logic conversion
2. Document generation tool creation
3. Question framework implementation
4. State management system

### Medium Priority
1. Template conversion and validation
2. Inter-agent communication patterns

4. Extended validation rules

## Conclusion

This comprehensive documentation preserves the complete knowledge base of the AgentPM multi-agent system. With 9 specialized agents, 17 document templates, 74 structured questions, and detailed methodologies documented, the migration to CrewAI can proceed with confidence that no critical business logic or domain expertise will be lost.

The preserved knowledge represents:
- **3,500+ lines** of template content
- **74 specialized questions** with validation logic
- **9 distinct agent personalities** with unique expertise
- **4-phase workflow** with state management
- **17 document types** with comprehensive structures

This knowledge base ensures the modernized system will maintain all current capabilities while leveraging CrewAI's improved architecture for better performance and maintainability.
