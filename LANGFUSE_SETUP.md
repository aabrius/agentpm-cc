# Langfuse Observability Integration

This document explains how to set up and use Langfuse for observability in AgentPM.

## What is Langfuse?

Langfuse is an open-source observability platform for LLM applications that provides:

- **Tracing**: Track conversation flows across multiple agents
- **Token Usage**: Monitor token consumption and costs by model
- **Performance**: Analyze response times and success rates
- **Analytics**: Gain insights into system usage patterns
- **Debugging**: Debug failed conversations and agent interactions

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Langfuse Account

1. Go to [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com) or set up self-hosted Langfuse
2. Create an account and project
3. Get your API keys from the project settings

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Langfuse Observability
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-your-secret-key-here
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-your-public-key-here
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

The Langfuse dependency is already included in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features Implemented

### üîç **Conversation Tracing**

Every conversation is automatically traced with:
- Conversation ID and type (idea/feature/tool)
- Agent interactions and handoffs
- Message flow between agents
- Phase transitions (discovery ‚Üí definition ‚Üí review)

### üìä **LLM Call Monitoring**

All LLM calls are tracked with:
- Model used (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- Input and output tokens
- Response time
- Cost estimation
- Success/failure status

### ü§ñ **Agent Performance**

Each agent's performance is monitored:
- Response times
- Success rates
- Error counts
- Token usage per agent

### üìã **Document Generation Tracking**

Document generation is tracked with:
- Generation time
- Success/failure status
- Document types generated
- Quality metrics

## API Endpoints

The following analytics endpoints are available:

### System Overview
```
GET /api/v1/analytics/system/overview
```

### Conversation Analytics
```
GET /api/v1/analytics/conversations/{id}/metrics
GET /api/v1/analytics/conversations/{id}/flow
GET /api/v1/analytics/conversations/{id}/export
```

### Agent Performance
```
GET /api/v1/analytics/agents/{id}/metrics
```

### Token & Cost Analysis
```
GET /api/v1/analytics/system/tokens
GET /api/v1/analytics/system/costs?group_by=agent
```

### Full Reports
```
GET /api/v1/analytics/reports/full
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analytics/health
```

### Get System Overview

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analytics/system/overview
```

### Get Conversation Metrics

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analytics/conversations/abc-123/metrics
```

### Get Token Usage

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analytics/system/tokens
```

### Get Cost Breakdown by Agent

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analytics/system/costs?group_by=agent
```

## Langfuse Dashboard

Once configured, you can view rich analytics in the Langfuse dashboard:

1. **Traces**: See complete conversation flows
2. **Generations**: View all LLM calls with prompts and responses
3. **Users**: Track usage by conversation type
4. **Sessions**: Group related conversations
5. **Datasets**: Build datasets for evaluation
6. **Experiments**: A/B test different prompts and models

## Key Metrics Tracked

### Conversation Level
- Total messages exchanged
- Conversation duration
- Agents involved
- Documents generated
- Success/failure status
- Token usage and costs

### Agent Level
- Response times
- Success rates
- Error frequencies
- Token consumption
- Handoff patterns

### System Level
- Total conversations
- Most active agents
- Popular conversation types
- Daily/weekly trends
- Cost optimization opportunities

## Data Privacy

- All data is processed according to Langfuse's privacy policy
- No sensitive user data is logged in traces
- Only conversation metadata and analytics are stored
- You can use self-hosted Langfuse for complete data control

## Troubleshooting

### Langfuse Not Working?

1. **Check environment variables**: Ensure keys are correctly set
2. **Verify connectivity**: Test API connection to Langfuse
3. **Check logs**: Look for Langfuse-related error messages
4. **API limits**: Ensure you haven't exceeded rate limits

### Missing Data?

1. **Flush events**: Call `/api/v1/analytics/flush` to force event upload
2. **Check filters**: Verify date ranges in analytics queries
3. **Async processing**: Allow some time for data to appear in dashboard

### Common Error Messages

- `"Analytics not available - Langfuse not configured"`: Set environment variables
- `"Failed to initialize Langfuse"`: Check API keys and connectivity
- `"Failed to track LLM call"`: Network or configuration issue

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Production Monitoring**: Track system health and performance  
‚úÖ **Cost Optimization**: Identify expensive operations and optimize  
‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**: Monitor conversation success rates  
‚úÖ **Debugging**: Quickly identify and fix issues
